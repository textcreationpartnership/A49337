            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>'TIS now full two years, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſince that huge din and noiſe, <hi>Pannick</hi> almoſt and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, has been in <hi>London,</hi> and elſewhere, occaſioned by this Treatiſe; and it has with a forcible hand, by threats and awes, from thence to this day been either with-held from, or in, the Preſs, inſomuch that thô actually conceived and come to the Birth, there wanted ſtrength to bring forth; my purpoſe is not to make much Apology in its behalf, it comes abroad of Age, <hi>natus cum barbâ,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay of <hi>Eſau;</hi> after a courſe of Studies upon full Thoughts, and a thorow Conſideration (though haſtened as thus digeſted by a Sermon I met with Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by <hi>John Tillotſon</hi> Doctor of Divinity and Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) and is to ſpeak for it ſelf; and, if upon a due peruſal,
<pb facs="tcp:48150:3"/>
the uſefulneſs and ſeaſonableneſs of the Subject matter, together with the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of the Collector (and which is here profeſſed) will not avouch it, what can, or why ſhould I ſay any more? I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to fall, and ſhall ſubmit. I do not pretend to be the beſt Compoſer in the World, or above the reach of an <hi>Ariſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and ſo let the Hypercritical, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice pick a Quarrel with it if they pleaſe. I hope the beſt, and that, as in thoſe fears called <hi>Pannick,</hi> and where the Jealouſie and Paſſion is vehement and ſubitaneous; ſo here, the Grounds, on which ſome have already excepted againſt it, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear rather aſſumed than real, an effect only of the Imaginative faculty, and which is many times diſmal, till by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon corrected.</p>
            <p>'Tis that which St. <hi>Jerome</hi> urges and aggravates againſt <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Pammachium ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſus errores Johannis Hieroſolymitani,</hi> that when accuſed of the Errors of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Arius,</hi> and was expected to have Purged himſelf, he Preach'd only againſt the <hi>Anthropomorphites,</hi> a certain ſort of obſcure ignorant Monks, who out of a Ruſtick Simplicity, believed God to have the Parts and Members of a Man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as ſpoken ſometimes in Scripture,
<pb facs="tcp:48150:3"/>
who influenced none, and periſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves. I may here ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my ſelf ſecure againſt ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency and indiſcretion; the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary I now engage againſt, is neither ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant nor obſcure, his repute for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is the ſame as his Conſpicuity; and that is, with <hi>Abſolom</hi> and his Fathers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, on the Houſe top, in the ſight of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> and the Sun, has paſſed both Preſs and the Pulpit, and is now in each almoſt Gentleman's Parlour, and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Shop, and in the Mouths of all Men, and he were to be wiſhed to be leſs in our Divines Studies; And after thoſe hotter Controverſies, in theſe We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Parts of the Chriſtian World, As whether Church-Power be originally lodged in the Perſon of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> or, in all and each of the Biſhops of Chriſtendom? or, in each ſingle Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter? or, as the leſs conſiderable, in every Believer? 'tis now concluded to be purely Secular, men roundly, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no Bones, run away with it, and no more than the Prince's Pleaſure is to be enquired after, nor are any Perſons or Functions to be accounted Sacred, in order to the things of Heaven, but by his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; or is there any viſible Power on this ſide Heaven, but by his collating.
<pb facs="tcp:48150:4"/>
Nor is the Subject trivial or inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and without influence upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: 'tis that Chriſt Jeſus had a Power, all Power in Heaven and Earth, once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him of the Father, for the bringing Souls to Heaven, this very Power firſt in him, after deſcended to his Apoſtles, and from them to their Succeſſion, the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church, and is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in and with them and their Perſons, apart and ſeparate from all other Power, Government and Juriſdiction, till the end cometh, and this Kingdom is delivered up to the Father, ſo long is it to be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and in force, under what frowns and oppoſitions ſoever, thô the Kings of the Earth ſtand up, and the Rulers take Council againſt it. And this is all I here repreſent to the World, and which, not by any Publick Autority; God be thanked the caſe is not ſo with us, but by a ſet of Men has been thus oppoſed, and who ſeem to be ſomewhat, whatſoever they be it matters not to me; I have always learn'd Obedience, but 'tis to them that are my Governors: but who are theſe? neither ſhall I give place by Subjection to them, no not an hour; ſo peculiar is my caſe, in an Age of Liberty, when the Statute for Printing is expired, and the Government has not thought fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enforce
<pb facs="tcp:48150:4"/>
it, when every Sect and Party Scribbles and Publiſhes; and a Treatiſe purely and ſolely ſtating and defending our Religion eſtabliſhed by Law, is brow-beaten, and a total Suppreſſion, is to the utmoſt endeavoured.</p>
            <p>I know they ſay 'tis not the ſubject in general, but my Animadverſions upon the two Deans, Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> and Doctor <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> they ſet themſelves and contend againſt; and pray how does this mend the matter? or is not theſe Mens Zeal for the Church of <hi>England</hi> bulky and active to the purpoſe, when its iſſue is this, that the Names and Writings of two particular Men, and which muſt be in ſo much leſs eſteem, and as falſe, as they diſcountenance, and are againſt our Church, and whoſe Tenents, ſo far as here impleaded, they dare not openly Plead for muſt be untoucht and uncan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed, or elſe the ſtate of the Church not medled with, its Power and Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity be diminiſh'd and expoſed by others, by who ſo pleaſes, and no Man defend it; it is not to be duly and fairly repreſented to the World, for their Information or Inſtruction, unleſs there be an exempt and indemnity to ſuch thoſe two, to thwart and oppoſe it as they ſhall think fit, or give themſelves advantages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb facs="tcp:48150:5"/>
from their Party, and ſuch their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torities ſtand unqueſtioned, as in Capital Letters, to affront and confute all ſo ſoon as Publiſhed? the Propoſal muſt be both ridiculous and unreaſonable at once; or how can any man undertake, (to make but this one inſtance at preſent) to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our Church from Eraſtianiſm, and that her Reformation did not enſtate all Church-Power, even in <hi>Edward</hi> VI. and when but a Child (and which I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is objected by <hi>Parſons</hi> the Jeſuit in his Three Converſions of <hi>England,</hi> and we are risked ſufficiently for it, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, if true) without rejecting Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Stillingfleets</hi> M SS. and which tells us, that both State and Church met at <hi>Windſor</hi> in his days, and determined it otherwiſe, and that the original and full Power of the Prieſthood was in him the Prince, as now abiding upon Earth, next under Chriſt?</p>
            <p>But how is it that I have really dealt with theſe two Doctors? being engaged in a Treatiſe, the reſult of the courſe of my Studies, I met, among ſeveral others, them my Adverſaries; as I did thoſe others, ſo alſo I detected their Errors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed their Reaſons, repelled their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and voided their Autorities in that particular, as well as I could; and is not
<pb facs="tcp:48150:5"/>
this what every Body does under theſe like Circumſtances? or did ever any Man engage upon a Subject, and not take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the known and obvious oppoſers and thwarters of him? ſurely never: and I have this to ſay for my ſelf, that I have never made one reflexion upon either of them, but where my ſubject directly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me to it; nor is there any thing that is Perſonal and Foreign that I have meddled withal. As for their Eminency in the Church, and Controverſies that are of high concern among us, and which they have diſcharged with a general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, I have not, any ways, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an abatement of their Merit, but this was ſo far from being an Argument, or but Motive to me, that I was not to encounter them on this Subject, that it moſtly prevailed with me to do it; doth the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go out as againſt a Flea? nor do thoſe of meaner Order and Quality undertake that Autority which is in it ſelf none, falls of it ſelf to the ground, nor was ever influential upon any? and had I had no ſenſe of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in points of ſo great concern that muſt neceſſarily accrue to the Church of God, under ſuch their Autorities in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages eſpecially, I had wholly paſſed them by, untouched and uncanvaſſed,
<pb facs="tcp:48150:6"/>
as the Combination expected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>What is farther urged, that we are not to create differences among our ſelves, and that we have Enemies enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, is moſt true; but that which makes our Enemies abroad, is that we do not unanimouſly aſſert and vindicate the one Faith and Truth, that we coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance thoſe among our ſelves which violate it; where diviſions already made, and other Doctrines brought in, this is the rule of St. <hi>Paul, Mark ſuch,</hi> and his Practice is the ſame upon the Rule; and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who ſeemed to be ſomewhat, and Pillars were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to the face by him; and the ſame Practice is every where in the Chriſtian Church apparent.</p>
            <p>I'le only add this one thing more, Whatever my firſt Error was, in deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this my Collection for the Preſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Approbation, and it appears they thought it my Duty to do otherwiſe; they had my Copy a full quarter of a year in their hands, and I am informed did Tranſcribe what ſeemed for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but never had I any notice any ways of my great miſtake, that it might be Corrected, or not Printed; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what I have anſwered be of force
<pb facs="tcp:48150:6"/>
that I burn my Papers, I durſt appeal to an eaſie Conſideration: or why did not the two Deans themſelves, inform me better, when I addreſſed my ſelf to each of them in a diſtinct Letter, and begg'd the favour that I might know what my fault was, and which the Injury that I had done? I have been credibly told that they ſaid my ſtyle was rough and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore they would not anſwer; I confeſs I did not conſider them in their ſtalls, and where I always pay that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Secular Power requires, and which alone places them there, but as ſtating to them a Point of Divinity, or which is more a Caſe of Conſcience, where Truth only is to be reſpected, and with a thorow Severity, and any thing but like a Complement is not to have place. But whatever my Letter was, and however they ſcorn to anſwer it, I am not aſhamed here to Print it, in the very words I ſent it to each of them apart, only the Site of their Names is changed as was the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Addreſs.</p>

I'le be ſo hold to ſay, you never obliged any man

                  <p>You are not Ignorant what Pleas are made for Errors againſt the Church, and of the Dammages accrew to her, by haling in particular Doctors, if but leaning that way and ſeeming ſuch, as their Abettors and Avouchers, and this by how much greater ſuch Doctors are of, or are eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in ſuch the Church: and then what aſtoniſhment muſt it be to good minded

with Scorn. <hi>That</hi> it hath been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Judgment of our ſucceeding Biſhops ever ſince. That a Biſhop's Power is not ſolitary and apart from that of a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, with many more of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>And for the ſevering theſe your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinions and particular Errors from the Doctrines of the Church of God, and reſcuing her from the great Scandal of them, ſhe muſt, or may undergo; I have engaged in that ſo laborious a Work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at our Saviour and his Apoſtles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended by the Biſhops, Doctors and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church Catholick, the Church Hiſtorians, Councils, and Laws Imperial, our own particular Church Canons, Rubricks, Book of Ordination, our own Doctors and Writers in their times, the Injunctions and Declarations of our Princes, the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-Book of our Kingdom, all which come in as one Evidence againſt them, you have ſtill time to do it and right your ſelves, and ſatisfie the Church of God in your own Perſons, removing the reproach occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by you, in an acknowledgment of the Error, for my Book is not yet in the Preſs, and which if you'l engage to do, I do here indent back again, to expunge whatever concerns or but mentions you in it.

ſhort to this purpoſe in ſeveral Paragraphs there, That every one is free upon the cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or diſcontinuance of the Miracle, to Superſede or Change his Religion, once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by that Miracle to be from God, and upon which account it was receiv'd and own'd, if the change of the Climate and his Governors, his former Education, and the preſent Cuſtom of the Place he reſides in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; and all that other Authority and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation from Heaven, obliged only for that preſent inſtant in which the Miracle was wrought and evidenced; I with leſs concern paſſed it by, reflecting on the Perſon, a Man affected with, and deſigning Novelty and Singularity, filled with a Conceit of his own worth and autority, and oppoſing it to all the World beſide. And in particular in this Chapter, declaring himſelf to be ſuch an one that believes <hi>an extraordinary felicity</hi> a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Teſtimony <hi>of a Divine Calling:</hi> but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in my Thoughts, and finding by a ſad Experience that it went further than the Scheme or Syſteme, that a great part of our Age is thereby brought into this Opinion; and 'tis contended for, ſo frequently, as their Faith, that the Church is nothing at all; but in the State, its Powers and Offices, though once in the Apoſtles, and ſome of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, for ſome time, is now gone with thoſe Miracles, that at that time abetted and avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them; nor is the Goſpel it ſelf to be Preached, or divulged upon other terms, or a fixed, enjoyned, falſe Religion oppoſed; nay farther, this very ſame to be the ſtated profeſſed Opinions of ſome, and thoſe too,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48150:22"/>
our higheſt dignified Church-men, and left upon Record, as the judgment of the greateſt part, and ſome of them the moſt remarkable, of our firſt Reformers, that the Prince is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with whatever belongs to a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; then was my heart hot within me, and while I was thus muſing, the fire kindled, and at the laſt I ſpake with my Tongue, I then ſet my ſelf upon a particular immediate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the Matter, and attaining to a more perfect knowledge of that way, I here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to my Fathers and Brethren of the Clergy, to all good Chriſtians whatever, in this following Treatiſe, and only ſtate the plain caſe as I find delivered down from our Saviour by his Apoſtles, the Biſhops, Fathers and Doctors of the Church Catholique, the Church Hiſtorians, Councils and Laws Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, from our own particular Church Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Canons, Rubricks, our Book of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and Homilies appointed to be read in the Churches in the time of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> from our own Doctors and Writers in Divinity, in their ſeveral times, and from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions and Declarations of our Princes, and even the Common-Law and Statute Book of our Kingdom, the Honor and Duty I owe to my Jeſus, to his Univerſal Church, to this particular Church of <hi>England,</hi> to my own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion as a Divine, and love to all Chriſtians, is what have engaged to it; other advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges I have none, nor are any propoſed; theſe Conſiderations alone are they which now makes the dumb Child ſpeak, looſes the ſtring of that Tongue that held its peace and ſaid nothing, and brings him into publick; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> NOW in order to this, I have ſo much prepared and made ready to my hands, that the thing in general is immediately denied by none, and that there is a Church-Power to be alwayes upon Earth, till the reſtitution of all things, and the Heavens be no more; that is, certain peculiar Perſons and Offices to be ſeparated and diſcharged in and for the affairs of Souls, and the guiding and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World in order to Heaven and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is affirmed by all that believe a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Chriſt Jeſus the Way, the Truth, and the Life in the Attainment. That which has ſo much unhing'd and diſcompos'd the World of late is, concerning the Subject in which it reſides; the particular Perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd and appointed by our Saviour for the conveyance and execution, the due force, juſt extent and conſequences of it, in whom this Power is to be found, and to whom limited, ſince none are extraordinarily by miraculous and ſenſible demonſtrations from Heaven commiſſioned and marked out thereunto; as the Apoſtles and firſt Publiſhers of the Goſpel were. And though Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> himſelf, as our great <hi>Herbert Thorndike,</hi> in his <hi>Principles of Chriſtian Truth,</hi> tells us, uſually ſaid in his common Diſcourſe, <hi>That all Church Power is an Impoſture;</hi> yet his Firſt Book <hi>De Synedriis,</hi> deſigned and levelled againſt this Autority. Upon this alone ſcore, becauſe preſumed in, and limited to the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church, as the Succeſſors of Chriſt and his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48150:23"/>
Apoſtles, makes it plain, his quarrel is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo aſſumed and limited by them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe transferr'd from the Prince or Civil Power, in whoſe hands alone he believes it placed, and in thoſe in deputation by him; and for which he contends all along in that Book (with what Succeſs may be ſeen here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) and therein places the <hi>Impoſture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE are three diſtinct Orders of Men,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> or at the leaſt to be ſuppoſed diſtinct, in which this Power is contended for to be ſeated, each excluſive of one another, by the ſeveral Aſſertors and Fautors of the diſtant Opinions and Parties among us. The One, places it in the People, the multitude of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in common, as the general firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſubject of Power Eccleſiaſtical, who by their concurrent Notes, Elections and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignations limit and fix it on particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for the Execution: ſo appointing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating, and inveſting for the work of the Miniſtry, to negotiate in the affairs of Souls, and in order to their Salvation. The Other ſubjects all in the Prince, or Secular Power, who is ſuppoſed in <hi>actu Primo,</hi> virtually and by a firſt inherency, to be Prieſt and People equally as Prince, and by the Right of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, as chief Magiſtrate upon Earth, is inſtructed for all Offices and Duties in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Heaven, with a Power for Deputation and Devolution, as the Harveſt may be great, or the Labourers few; upon each occaſion requiring, and as he is pleaſed by his ſecular Hand to mark out the Perſon. The Third place it not in the Multitude in general, or in the Prince in ſpecial; but in a certain
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48150:24"/>
indefinite number of Believers, called and impower'd thereunto, not by their Gifts and Abilities as Chriſtians in common, but by a particular ſignal Donation ſuperadded, given and left, firſt by Chriſt to his Apoſtles, and from them in Succeſſion devolved on the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Paſtors of the Church, in whom it now remains, who alone have the Power of its conveyance, and on whomſoever it is they ſhall lay their hands, together with the offices of Prayer, or by any other outward Symbol, overt Act or Teſtimony, which they ſhall uſe to evidence the Deputation, transfer it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, theſe ſhall receive this Power of the Holy Ghoſt, be thorowly enabled for the tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting betwixt God and Man, the things that belong to Man's Eternity.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>IV</label> THE deſign of this preſent Diſcourſe is, to take away the two former, and eſtabliſh the latter, to make it evident upon a juſt Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and certain Demonſtration, That all Church-Power was deſigned by Chriſt, and actually left by his Apoſtles only to Church-Officers, the Order of the Goſpel-Prieſthood, the Biſhops, Presbyters and Deacons, to be ſeparated on purpoſe and ſucceſſively inſtated in ſuch the Juriſdiction and Government, by ſuch of themſelves that had before received, and were fully inveſted with it; and this like other Succeſſions, to continue and be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, till the End cometh, and the Kingdom be delivered up to the Father. So that the general Heads I ſhall inſiſt upon, will be theſe Three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Power is not in the People or Chriſtians in common.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:48150:24"/>2. That it is not in the Prince or Secular Government.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it is in the Biſhops and Paſtors of the Church of Chriſt, a Power and Offices pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly theirs, as to the execution, with its ſpecial force and Laws, reaching to all that come to Heaven by Chriſt Jeſus, and as not derived from, ſo no ways thwarting or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with the Civil Government. And all this, as ſuitable to the received Faith and Polity of the Church in the beſt Ages of it, down from Chriſt and his Apoſtles to us ward; ſo it agreeing with the particular Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments of the Laws of our Kingdom made for the owning and defence of our Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and alſo with the Religion of the ſame received and profeſſed in our Church ſince the Reformation.</p>

of the People in the conſtituting a Church-man? And this ſay ſome, in the ſame order of neceſſity as the Concurrency of the Clergy; that although the Suffrages of the People do not confer and collate Church-Power apart and ſolitary, and where the hands of the Presbytery is not; yet the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery cannot do it without them, 'tis nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther legal, juſt, nor duly performed if ſo attempted, ſomething is wanting, not only for outward Atteſtation, but for the real tranſlation of Autority on the heads of the Ordained.

And <hi>David Blondel,</hi> the moſt Induſtrious of the Presbyterian Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in his Apology <hi>Pro Hieronimo,</hi> ſpends many Pages in the latter end of that Treatiſe, in giving the Practice of the Church for Ten Centuries, admitting this Power of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Ordinations, and that they have equal right thereto, and are alike conſtituted by Chriſt, his Vicars in the caſe, with the Clergy, <hi>Laicos fratres, equo cum clero jure, Chriſti hac in parte vicarios conſtitutos,</hi> pag. 471. and upon which he fixes a Divine right immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

And this <hi>Blondel</hi> in part grants, but firſt inſinuates, that it might be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, though ſecret and not declared, and then poſitively affirms that it was ſo, upon a bottom equally precarious; becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles practiſed and delivered to us what they copied from Chriſt, who ſtill call'd in the whole Fraternity and required their Votes in each Ordination, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Duty ſo obliged, <hi>Pag.</hi> 475. and

That the Hands of the Presbytery did conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate, we read expreſly, and we read of none elſe; and ſuch the Presbytery, <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> have the alone Charge and Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated, to Inſpect and Animadvert upon their Lifes and Manners, to receive or reject as their Prudence directs; the Clergy are ſole Judges, 'tis not required, that the People, ſo much as preſent; every particular Man's inward deſire, and private Motions (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing other due qualifications concurring) made known to ſuch whoſe is the Power for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, ſeems ſufficient, if any man deſire the Office of a Biſhop, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. and that theſe Epiſtles are to be follow'd, as the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern in the Mount, the Platform and Model of Church-Government, theſe Men ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly plead at other times; and thoſe other inſtances of Ordinations in Scripture brought by <hi>Blondel,</hi> conclude nothing more.

of <hi>Matthias,</hi> there is no ſuch thing expreſs at all; the Believers being few—were all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place, and they were neceſſitated ſo to be; but that they otherwiſe concurr'd then by their preſence; or that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Speech was directed to them and not to the Apoſtles only, is not thence to be inferr'd; that in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. was chiefly, he ſays only; to provide Deacons to look after their Poor; and good reaſon was there, the People ſhould approve of ſuch in whoſe hands their Moneys was to be depoſited; nor can any inference be hence made on his ſide, unleſs the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be good, that ſuch as are fit and able to chooſe and depute in whoſe hands their Money ſhall be entruſted, are for the ſame reaſon, inſtructed to Skill and chooſe their Teachers; or that we ſet a lower price on mens Souls, than we do on their Money; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we can allow the Laity to provide for the latter; but we think there ought to be better proviſion made, and more care taken for the former. What is argued farther from the parity of the Call and Conſecration of <hi>Aaron,</hi> Heb. 5. is full levell'd againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; where to be ſure all concurrency of the People was excluded, in every reſpect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>WE'll go on from Scripture-inſtances to <label type="milestone">

               <p>SO that <hi>David Blondel</hi>'s deſign of a Divine <label type="milestone">

Surely if this be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the diſadvantage will be their own, in a point of a higher concern, if Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Eccleſiaſtical practice ſtill amount to a Divine immutable Law. And indeed it would be of real ill conſequence, in many conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable caſes that would ariſe in the true Church of Chriſt; for although the matter of Fact be evident, it has been receiv'd and practiſed in the Churches firſt and beſt Ages; yet it may be a doubt what the Obligation was to them who then receiv'd it, and whoſe practice it was? whether as abſolute and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, and conſequently, how it now rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches us? every Truth and Matter of Fact, has not the ſame degree of Neceſſity in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Uſe, nor do his Brethren more go againſt him here, than he againſt himſelf; I might refer to his own Text, but the <hi>Ireni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi> has done it before me, (<hi>p.</hi> 401.) joyning him with <hi>Bochart,</hi> and <hi>Amiraldus</hi> in the cauſe, of which his <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> as he calls them, <hi>Blondel</hi> is there placed in the head, and all to make good that one great Truth, by their Autority, which is vaſt and unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, (and to defend which is the great buſineſs of that Treatiſe of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48150:37"/>
Presbyters, they engroſſed the Right of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining them, and never required the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currency of the Clergy, and the People, ſpurr'd on by Fame, and Vain-glory, and Secular Intereſt; and that is the reaſon why there is no Canons expreſs, and very few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the Peoples chooſing Presbyters and Deacons. Nor does it in the original right diminiſh their Power, becauſe wreſted from them, (<hi>pag.</hi> 469, 470.) and all which is one, among the many Fictions and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, the whole Apology is ſtuffed withal, and every ways like himſelf, who, according to his uſual good Nature, and Malice to the Order it ſelf, ſtill lays what dirt he can at the doors of the moſt eminent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the Biſhops and Prelates of the Church of Chriſt, not conſidering, or, rather not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, what injury the common Chriſtianity thereby receives, through the ſides of theſe its known Martyrs and Confeſſors, ſo be he can but fill up his private Congregation; a guilt not eaſily to be removed from too many of the <hi>French</hi> Reformation, eſpecially from <hi>Dailee</hi> in his Book of the Uſe of the Fathers; and the abundance of Irreligion in general, in theſe parts of the World ows it ſelf in a great meaſure to it. And to ſee the unlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, and how his ill Nature returns un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably upon himſelf, what he attributes to the Biſhops Pride and Arrogancy, and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſt, in aſſuming and engroſſing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Power which was not theirs, that they ordained Presbyters and Deacons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the People and Clergy, that the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of both might be the ſurer upon them,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48150:37"/>
and certainly be their Slaves and Vaſſals, and which is the invidious deſign of his whole Book, how eaſily is it all return'd on his own pate? and to what elſe can any one impute this his clawing with and condeſcending to the People to be, but his own, and the other of his Brethrens dependance upon them, as it is at this day in <hi>France?</hi> and 'tis wholly in the Power of the Congregation, both to Vote in, and Eject their Miniſter at pleaſure, to beſtow what Maintenance upon them their Wiſdom directs; nor is it at all in the Power of the Clergy, as things are now with them, ſtreightned by the Civil Sword, to avoid or amend it; to them indeed, in their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the good-liking and choice of the People are neceſſary, otherwiſe they muſt change the Climate, their Churches and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry muſt ceaſe and fall together. And this I ſay, not to inſult over and upbraid them, for their caſe in general is really to be pitied; but thus do outward accidents imbody them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and become as of the real Subſtance; and too many Models and Syſtems, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions have ſome regard, too much yielding and complyance with them; this one thing does it generally need a Pardon, and to them in particular it cannot eaſily be granted, it may with great juſtice be called their Pride and Uſurpation, that what is their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable Neceſſity; what the frowns and injuries of their Native Countrey they live in, the want of Countenance and Protection from the Prince, and of a due Proviſion by Laws, and which in reaſon ought to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, lays upon them, this they'l obtrude

upon us, upon all Churches, as the Pattern upon the Mount, the Platform, not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated from, every ways to be copied out, upon no leſs a peril than the breach of an antecedent immutable Law, an Inſtitution from Heaven. What ought to be their care to repreſent as fairly as they can, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterially command; other Churches are condemned for not obeying, a fault the Churches of the <hi>French</hi> Reformation are no ways to be acquitted of. That there is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination among Clergy-men, and a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as on one Head and Superior in the ſeveral degrees of the Prieſthood, this is moſt certain, 'tis bottomed on as good and known Autority as our Religion it ſelf, and which will be made to appear by and by in this Treatiſe, though not as the buſineſs of it. The Deacon is a Miniſter or Servant to the Biſhop, and both Presbyter and Deacon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Power and Deputation from him; but in any other ſenſe we own no Head or Maſter, Servants, Miniſters we are but of God and Chriſt, of the Goſpel which we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter unto them, of which we are Stewards for their advantage and relief, diſpenſing to every man his Portion, miniſtring in our courſes, as the Angels in theirs, for the good of all, a faithful Miniſter of Chriſt for you; ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.23. and in this alone conſiſts our <gap reason="foreign">

the People; but the Biſhops (whoſe indeed Curates they are) for this Thouſand years downwards; and it will very hardly be found a ſufficient proof for its Illegality, to ſay there was no Controverſie moved about it before; and therefore it was otherwiſe, but not mentioned, or in his nauſeous, impious, precarious, uſual manner of ſpeaking, when any thing of this nature pinches him, that it was from the Pride and Uſurpation, <hi>faſtus indomabilis</hi> (Pag. 64.) of the Biſhops, and yet he exclaims as if all Religion lay at ſtake, a thorow Degeneracy and Diſſolution, both in People and Clergy, they all become neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and contemned of one another; all the diſorder, ill manners and failures in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is imputed to this one thing, whatever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies in Church are obſervable (and always ſome there will be) all hence ariſe, that the People have not the chooſing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of him that is to officiate among them, have only the opportunity of bewailing with their Tears a vacancy upon Death, but not of repairing it; that <hi>Odor priſcae Diſciplinae,</hi> the Primitive Proceedings being gone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come even a ſtink to the Noſtrils of a looſer Age; the immutable fixed Rule of Chriſt laid aſide and broken, or in plain terms, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Genius and Complexion of theſe Men obſerved already; becauſe all the well-ſetled duly conſtituted Churches in Chriſtendom do not diſſolve and fall in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are not framed anew into the acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal neceſſitous Model, of a private <hi>French</hi> Congregation.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>III</label> this the main Caſe in Debate amongſt us in this unhappy Age of ours. Whether the Kingly and Prieſtly Offices and Charges immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in their Natures and Conſtitutions imply and include each other? Not that they agree in one deſign, or more, in ſome Externals; but whether where the one is, there the other, as a neceſſary conſequence, is at the ſame time, and by the ſame appointment, exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? and to which I am to anſwer in the Negative; as to be a Prieſt has never inferr'd, a Secular Power, ſo nor to be a Prince the Spiritual. For the full cleering of this point it will be neceſſary firſt to conſider the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Gifts, Duties, Offices and Power in general, how far they include and infer one another; how far each one in it ſelf is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, and from what Principle flowing; and 'tis a Conſideration ſo abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for whoſo engages in this or ſuch-like Debates, and their Reſolutions, that he muſt otherwiſe be at a loſs, and miſs of the aim propoſed. To Virtue and Goodneſs in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, there is in every Man an innate Power; he has Faculties concreated, and of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, and this improveable by Induſtry and Care, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices and Experiences, and God in courſe, as he incourages and preſerves whatever is his own, gives more help: The Art of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian and Skill of a Divine, are alſo attainable in the like way, by a Progreſs of Study and continued Obſervations, upon an hability, or firſt ſtock within; but this not equally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and ingraffed in each, as is a Power to Goodneſs, Wiſdom, Knowledge is not to all. The Power of a Father over his Child is from God, by virtue and force of the relation laid
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48150:55"/>
in the foundation of it; becauſe begetting him, and by the general concourſe of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; the Power of a Husband over a Wife, and a Maſter over a Servant is by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, upon a particular Covenant or Stipulation; the Power of Government and Juriſdiction in the greater extent; whether of a King in the State, or a Prieſt in the Church, enabling each to diſcharge the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Duties belonging to them, comes quite different from each before; 'tis by no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Nature, or any thing within a Man, concreated, and a common concurſe of Providence contributes not; nor can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notices, or whatever particular Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and Experience attain unto it; no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular act of Man, whether Moral or Natural, is a foundation ſufficient for theſe greater relations, and higher inſtances of Power, whether of his Perſon apart, or by compact with others; 'tis, as always lodged in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons, or when it was once in one and the ſame; ſo by diſcriminating marks, diſtinct ſymbols, in the conveyance, and appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby to diſcern the one from the other, the Secular Power, by Deſcent, or Votes; or, in ſome inſtances, Conqueſt; the Spiritual, by the Deputations of the Biſhop, and the Acts and Offices are quite apart and different; (as is the deſign of this Diſcourſe to make fully appear) but in this they agree, and are as one; becauſe immediate from God, by a ſpecial concurſe and devolution, and ſo depoſited into particular hands and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; no Force, no Virtue, no Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Overtures, in any Action or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48150:56"/>
by any Perſon or Perſons amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; they are both higheſt Powers, in their kind and ſphere; and 'tis ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and ſolitary, and which none elſe have which makes them ſo, and conſequently none elſe can give it them, becauſe ſuppoſed not to have it; but only he, who is tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the higheſt, and eminently above all, and does, and can, give to each Son of Man as he pleaſes. And now, ſince each of theſe Gifts, and Offices and Powers, are attain'd to, convey'd and devolv'd, in ſeveral cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, methods and ways, one and the ſame Symbol, Compact or Act, does not produce and evidence their exiſtence in and to the World, inveſt with the Power, inſtate in the Poſſeſſion, enable and engage all men alike, to the attainment, the Duties and Offices of them; hence the Conſequence is as clear in the courſe and chain of things, as it is in Matter of Fact, the Practice and known every day's Experience of the World, that they are not any, but two, much more all of them, in any one degree of Neceſſity; as to their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence, they do not any ways include, or infer each other; one Virtue, 'tis true, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes and infers another; and all Virtues, I ſpeak of practical Virtues, <hi>Bonum ex cauſa integrâ,</hi> and Goodneſs is all of one chain, and where true in any one inſtance, is all together; but yet this Goodneſs, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, includes not Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a Virtuous Man has not always the moſt Knowledge; nor where this Knowledge is, is it always Univerſal: To be a Divine is not to be a Phyſitian, or were it always
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48150:56"/>
Univerſal, this infers no one branch of Power; <hi>Solomon</hi>'s poor Wiſe man had none at all, and ſo it may be with the richeſt and wiſeſt, 'tis too often ſo; nor doth any inſtance of Autority and Power where exiſting, infer all other inſtances of it. To be the Husband of a Wife, is not therefore to be the Father of a Child; nor do Paternal and Deſpotick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment either, neceſſarily go together; to be a King indeed is uſually to be all, but to be a Prieſt is oft to be neither; he is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times too poor to have Servants, and his Marriage is by ſome judg'd unlawful, at leaſt by Church-Law forbidden; and every one ſays he ought not to be a King; to be ſure he is not ſo becauſe a Prieſt; nor is the King a Prieſt either becauſe a King, they no more infer one another, than do any of the former two, or all of them; nor is their co-exiſtence otherways neceſſary, than any of the other; they indeed were once united in the Worlds Infancy, and ſome Ages after, both ſeated in the firſt born; though by what ſpecial grant, we know not, the ſmall account we have of thoſe Ages hinders it; only I cannot agree with <hi>Grotius De Imper.

All the links and contig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Government were taken down, or burſt in ſunder; whether of the Father over his Child, or Husband over his Wife, or

Maſter over his Servant, or Sovereign over his Subjects, or Prieſt over the People; all were Chriſt's Freemen, and to be Servants to none; only the knack was found out at laſt, that the King was to be a Prieſt, when both King and Prieſt were firſt diſabled; and their Autority, either in deſign or actually taken from them. The Bible it ſelf was then put into his hands, with a Right to all Church-Offices, when the Right to his Liege Subjects was denied him, with a Power to make the Scriptures Canonical, and to diſcharge all its Duties, to lay limits by his Laws to Religion, though <hi>a falſe one,</hi> and it is not permitted <hi>openly to draw Men off from the Profeſſion of it,</hi> (ſo Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> tells us in his Sermon) when to govern his Subjects by Law is Tyranny, and Uſurpation: So advantageouſly is this new Honor and higher Dignity, that his entrance to the Prieſtly-Office, placed on him, and the conſequence was only this, both King and Prieſt was brought to a Morſel of Bread, were brought to the Block, the Saints in the Right of their Power, cut off the Heads both of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, &amp; the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> the Father was againſt the Son, and the Son againſt the Father, as when the Sea-marks are removed, the Walls, &amp; Water-locks and Floodgates are broken down, and pluckt up; this greater preſent deluge of profeſſed Atheiſm, Prophaneneſs and Immorality is broken in upon us, over-ſpread the face of our Earth in the natural courſe and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it; the Foundations are caſt down, and what can the Righteous do? the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> will have their Pope to be a King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48150:58"/>
it may be as well ſaid, that the Holy Veſſels and Altar became Kings, as that the Kings became Prieſts, upon the alone general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of being anointed; but admit it had been otherwiſe under the <hi>Jewiſh Policy,</hi> and the King by his Unction had the full Extent and Latitude of Power and Offices conferr'd, by the Ceremony of Oyl, devolv'd and ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him. What is this to us in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church? under another Head, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Polity, and ſeveral Diſpenſation? or how doth it oblige us, that our Kings muſt be Prieſts, becauſe the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were once ſo? Surely no otherwiſe than it oblig'd the <hi>Jews</hi> that their firſt-born were to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings or Prieſts or both, becauſe it was once ſo with their Anceſtors and Predeceſſors, and which is nothing at all; unleſs to be a King originally and in its Nature, included the Prieſthood, by a perpetual Force and Law never to be broken, and which their own inſtances deſtroy; and did not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and frame of the Governments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forbid it? for the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> is the foundation and direction of both Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both Political and Eccleſiaſtical, and which the Law of our Saviour is not, Civil Power is it altogether, and in every inſtance antecedent and independent to that Power which is from the Goſpel; the Law of Chriſt ſuppoſes it, only adds, by its Precepts of Juſtice and Virtue, greater Awe and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, new Motives for Obedience and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; yet the particular very ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence could by no means be allow'd us, to take and give Meaſures and Rules to the

Our Kings of <hi>England,</hi> 'tis plain, owe no one inſtance of their Power to the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, much leſs to their being then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, one but particular Ceremony in the Performance of it; and all Juriſdictions and Rights they have as Kings, they have before, and are to enjoy their whole life-time; Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they were neither anointed, nor, even Crown'd at all, 'tis all an high Ceremony, Solemn and Magnificent, Peculiar, as is the Perſon, and Power and Majeſty of a Prince, as is becoming a Crown Imperial when ſet on his Head, and the anointing may be uſed, as very lively ſignificant and expreſſing that ſeparation of his Perſon, which was due and made and acknowledged before, and really in him, as has been the Cuſtom by Oyl ſo to ſever and ſet apart Perſons and Things; but that the thing it ſelf is either comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or expected by God, or deſign'd and uſed by Man to any other end, ſervice or purpoſe, I never could yet underſtand. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Blondel,</hi> in his <hi>Formula regnante Chriſto, Pag.</hi> 119. tells us, that the Unction, or

Cuſtom of anointing Princes, was not uſed, among Chriſtians, till the year of our Lord 750. and the Conſecration of their King <hi>Pippin,</hi> and it was often repeated, as twice, four, five times a year, as he inſtances in ſeveral Princes, and makes evident it is not look't upon as an initiating inveſting Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, whatever elſe uſe they appropriated to it; though afterwards it was adjudged Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge to iterate it, by a growing Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and aſſum'd Opinion of it; the famous Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris, De Marca,</hi> in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Preface to his Book <hi>De Concord.</hi> &amp;c. and in the Second Book, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it ſelf, tells us of ſome in the Greek Church, that were of the Opinion, that the Prince had the Prieſtly Power by virtue of his Unction: And it was defined in a Synod held at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the year of our Lord Nine hundred and ſeventy, that the anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Emperor gives him the ſame Power to forgive Sins, as has the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and the Greeks out of the ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of flattery managed the ſame Opinion, and gave their Emperor the ſame Power as hath the Patriarch; but this, as we are told, depended moſtly on a Faction then on foot, as it was in it ſelf precarious and Arbitrary, &amp; ſo wee'l leave it to its firſt bottom, which is none at all, nor needs it any farther Conſideration.</p>

And in Anſwer to which groundleſs Plea, and Objection, I ſhall add farther, either the Biſhops and Doctors and Confeſſors of the Chriſtian Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood this Caſe, as thus ſtated, That this Power was not really in themſelves, and their execution of it was but accidental, forced, under the preſent Circumſtances, and to return to ſuch Governors in State as ſhould become Chriſtians, as its proper Seat or Subject? or they did not underſtand it? To ſay they did not underſtand it, is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48150:66"/>
and repreſent them to all Ages ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, guilty of Ignorance groſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, to give that for certain Truth, which ſome of our Reformers have made their Libel and Objection, againſt theſe firſt and Holy Chriſtians. That they were more Zealous than Wiſe, Pious, but imprudent leſs diſcerning men, and from whom Truth is not to be had nor expected, and which is in effect to put a baffle upon our whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in general, and to lay a ground for miſtruſt upon each of its particulars, it muſt receive a great blow upon ſuch Suppoſals, when reflected upon and conſidered, that thoſe who alone propagated our Faith for Three hundred years together, did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Power and Autority they were inveſted with in order to it, or the true te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or ſtate of it. To ſay they did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, then ſurely it had been ſtated by them, a Model of it drew up, and left, at leaſt for Poſterity; a thing ſo in courſe, and moſt uſual in other caſes, thus to give Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, Schemes and Draughts of the Deſign and Purpoſe; eſpecially when to propoſe, attempt, and carry on ſomething that is but new, not before received; much more when thwarting to the common Sentiments, and Apprehenſions of Mankind; That no Men, but ſuch as the Chriſtians were given out to be by their Oppoſers and Perſecutors, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Fools, the followers of a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a few Fiſhermen, can be ſuppoſed guilty of. Certainly the occaſion and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that particular Power they then exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the Church, different from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48150:67"/>
nay, when enjoyned and commanded the contrary, by thoſe Powers, that they act and ſpeak no more in that Name, when Perſecuted to Bonds and Impriſonment, moreover unto Death for it; had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and publiſhed, to ſuch thoſe Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, a Manifeſto or Remonſtrance made of it to all Princes of the World; certainly among the many Apologies that were made to the Empire in their own behalf, this had had a ſhare, a room at leaſt, in ſome one of them. That what Juriſdiction was then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by them, the Paſtors of the Church, was only under the preſent Neceſſity, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent contrivance of their own, to keep their Followers and Adherents in ſome tolerable Peace and Order; to awe and reſtrain as they could, better an aſſumed Uſurped Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment than none at all; that the real and whole Government was laid upon theirs, the Magiſtrates, ſhoulders alone, would they but be pleaſed to come in to the Faith, and ſuſtain and execute it. What a plauſible, even, cogent Argument is here all along omitted, to let the Powers of the World know, what a conſiderable Portion of their Birth-right, as Princes, they neglect, and diſown, abdicate and relinquiſh? what a real damage and diſadvantage they receive, in not coming in to the Church? what a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Jewel would be added to their Crown in ſo doing?

Thus to be the Fountain and Head of all Rule, and every Juriſdiction, to inveſt or abdicate, to oblige or puniſh, ſo great, ſo conſiderable a Sect as are the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to conſtitute and influence, to depoſe and remove, every way, to govern at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; their Biſhops and Paſtors, who thus grow upon the World, and influence all Men; the Motive could never have been neglected; the Argument muſt have had a great deal of room in their ſeveral Apologies and Embaſſies, to the Empire, in behalf of themſelves and their Religion, who ſpared nothing like an Argument, that might but ingratiate, and inſinuate into their good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and liking; as 'tis evident from ſuch their Writings; and yet there is not one word there of any ſuch Pleadings, or any thing like it, but the quite contrary; as it hath been already made to appear. I'le go on farther, and aſſert, that 'tis very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, if not our Saviour himſelf, yet, that the Apoſtles ſhould not have done all this, and thus ſtated the caſe down to the World;

and yet no man ſets theſe two Powers of the Church and State more apart than does St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo leaves them. To inſtance in no more at preſent, he often exhorts, That they obey Magiſtrates, and that they alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thoſe that have rule over them, who have ſpoken to them the Word of God, and his Biſhop has his diſtinct care over the Church of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. has his things to ſet in order, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. a Power to Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon by Proceſs, to receive Accuſations, as in Court, as upon a Seat of Judicature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore witneſſes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19, 20. though no Power to lay either Confinement, or any other corporal outward Puniſhment on their Perſons.

And indeed all the Cautions, Rules and Directions, given to the Biſhops in theſe inſtances, imply only that they might erre in the execution; the Power is all along ſuppoſed in the Church, nor is it by the Prince attempted; as he does not Excommunicate, though ſeeing juſt reaſon for it, ſo neither does he abſolve upon the unjuſteſt cenſures denounced; wherein one Prieſt has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, it has been enjoyn'd another, remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Majori Sacerdoti,</hi> to a higher Order and Juriſdiction, to the Metropolitan, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, as was the Church Cuſtom to appeal to the Superior, <hi>Novel.</hi> 123.11.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48150:93"/>
off by him, and their Religion was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd after their own manner again. The meaning of which can be only this, that the Laws of the Empire gave Licenſe and Indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to their Perſons in the ancient and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed exerciſe of it, and which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and were thankful for. But does it hence follow that they acknowledged, and return'd their Original Right, either for their Worſhip in general, or Excommunication in particular, in, and to, <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and that they ceaſed to have any becauſe denied by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire? ſurely not; they only were more ſtreight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in its exerciſe, when under his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.

another Fountain, and the Empire does not derive it unto them, and <hi>Gallio</hi> the Secular Deputy, could diſcharge his Duty, without caring for any of theſe things, when the Matters were purely of their Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms; but yet their Perſons, and the Publick exerciſe of it, are ſubject to this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Juriſdiction, to limit, or enlarge, indulge, or recall, as may be the Reaſons and Motives; and, is his Will and Pleaſure: Thus it ſtood with the Jewiſh Church, in the days of our Saviour in the Fleſh, and of his Apoſtles, and ſo it is to this day, where the Aſſociation, or imbodying is continued; nor did the Empire conceive its Power any ways intrenched upon or abated thereby, did he ceaſe upon the account of their Worſhip, to continue to them his Protection; or had they any ingagement to withdraw their Obedience, only thoſe uncircumciſed in Hearts and Ears, which always reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt, and Crucified the Lord of Life; ſometimes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted Inſurrections and Rebellions againſt him.</p>

in ſuch a caſe reaſonably Pretend to, is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Private and Exerciſe of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Religion; for which they ought to be very thankful, and to forbear the open making of Proſelytes to their own Religion (though they be never ſo ſure that they are in the right) till they have either an extraordinary Commiſſion from God to that Purpoſe, or the Providence of God make way for it by the Permiſſion of the Magiſtrate.</hi> That there has been always a Spiritual, Eccleſiaſtical Power in the World, as derived, and received once by the Holy Ghoſt, and not of Man, ſo preſerved, and propagated, devolved and continued from the ſame Fountain, in order to the firſt great end, for the ſupport and continuance of the ſame Religion, though the <hi>extraordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions</hi> have ceaſed, which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>firſh Publiſhers</hi> of <hi>the Goſpel</hi> had, though by preſent <hi>Miracles</hi> not to <hi>be juſtified.</hi> And this equally enabling and warranting the Church of God, ſuch as can evidence the Succeſſion of Power, in its own and appointed way, as when <hi>Miracles</hi> were annexed, to <hi>affront,</hi> is an improper Speech, but to Teach, Declare and Proteſt againſt <hi>the Eſtabliſh'd Religion of a Nation</hi> if a <hi>falſe one, openly to draw Men off from the Profeſſion of it, in Contempt,</hi> is again an ill Expreſſion, but in different ways and rules of Duty, then thoſe <hi>falſe</hi> ones of the <hi>Law and Magiſtrate;</hi> though the Men of the World do Publiſh their diſlike and threaten and puniſh, and go on into a <hi>Law</hi> againſt them, as they did when Chriſtianity was firſt Taught, and Church-Power firſt came down, was ſetled and profeſſed in the

World; though the Kings of the Earth ſtand up together, and the Rulers take Council, they riſe up as one Man, as did <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and all the Gentiles, againſt the Child Jeſus; as it was then the Apoſtles, ſo is it no leſs our Duty, thus to ſpeak before Kings, and not be aſhamed. Church-Power came firſt into the World, as not from the School of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> ſo nor from the Thrones of Kings; and 'tis independant and diſtant as in its riſe, ſo in its execution, though em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh'd, aſſiſted and ſtrengthened, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged much, by the outward favours of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their many Adjuncts and royal Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages, and which where conferr'd, will equally embelliſh and add to their own Crowns, to be ſure, in Heaven. And upon theſe terms to ſuffer, will be our Duty, if what we profeſs be not received, it will amount to Martyrdom. If the King's wrath be the return, and our Doctrine with our ſelves be caſt out; and if we do not this, it will come too near the Traditores, in the days of the Donatiſts, or to thoſe that offer'd at Heathen Shrines in the Perſecutions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what will it be, but to give up our Bibles and Profeſſion, upon the Summons of any prevailing Party, to give up, to be ſure, our Church-Power, and which amounts to, in effect the ſame; nor can Chriſtianity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue without it, when upon Perſwaſion of the <hi>Arians;</hi> firſt, upon point, as he thought, of intereſt, receiving his Father's Will from an <hi>Arian</hi> Prieſt; and then by the <hi>Miletians,</hi> joyning with them, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Emperor engaged againſt the Faith of <hi>one Subſtance;</hi>

neceſſity, and upon a common conſent and compact; the Chriſtians being then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heathen Governors, to whoſe Judicatures it was neither for their Safety nor Honor to Appeal, and ſtand their Trial and Verdict; and therefore they reſolv'd it all into the chief Church-men, and which Power, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> becoming Chriſtian, and ſo the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Emperors, confirmed by his Royal Autority, and continued, of his own choice and motion unto them. This is the common tattle of the wiſer Men, as they think, and are generally ſo reputed, reporting it to the World, with much Confidence; and yet upon no other ground than old Womens Stories are told and bottom'd, at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt; they'l tell you, that Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> ſaid ſo; and every one is as ſecure of its Autority and Credit, as if they had read it in the Goſpel of our Saviour, or in one of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, when 'tis all as falſe as the Goſpel it ſelf is true. Great and many were the Priviledges, Royal Favours and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> beſtow'd upon the Church and Church-men, he receiv'd them with both hands, and with him in the Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, could he have found a third, he would have gave it them. He annex'd to them Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts and Appendages, which their Lord and Maſter, Chriſt Jeſus, did not, could not, would not do, his Kingdom being not of this World; nor was it his buſineſs to divide In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances, and he had all the reaſon in the world for it, <hi>Chriſtianus nulli Inimicus praeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim Imperatori,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian;</hi> a Chriſtian is an Enemy to no Man, eſpecially the Emperor,

whom he acknowledges, as a Man immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under God, that receives his Power only from God; nor hath any Man a Power above and beyond him; to Obey and Serve him is his Conſcience, his Religion, and he expects his Heaven, his eternal Salvation by it; and indeed Chriſtianity is the great, truly rational, permanent Support of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and Bodies Politick. What favour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſhew'd the Chriſtians, was his real particular Intereſt, and perhaps he could not have retain'd his Empire, had not the Chriſtian Biſhops been of his ſide, without their Aid and Aſſiſtance; and, as by them his Crown might be fixed the more firm and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure on his Head, who yet gave him not his Original Right unto it, for that was his, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other terms than his Chriſtianity he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed; nor did they add one cubit to his Power in this ſenſe, Dominion is not founded in Grace; ſo did they receive from him his outward aid and aſſiſtance, for the more due and advantageous execution of that Power they had, but not from him; they had exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed before he was Emperor, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with leſs ſucceſs, by a Donation ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to his, by a Right from Chriſt Jeſus; thus the Empire became their Nurſing-Father, to ſupport and encourage, but did not, could not give their Power, as Church-men unto them. As God gave to the Empire the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, ſo he gave to the Biſhops the Government of the Church, and which they were to uſe for the Empires ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; but might not uſe it againſt him: And all this <hi>Conſtantine</hi> well knew, and was

                  <p>Church-Power is a Specifick, conſtituted by Chriſt, in order to a Succeſſion; the erecting a new and laſting Government upon Earth; a Community of divers Orders, Offices, Acts, Stations, every ways peculiar, the Body of Chriſt, <hi>Sect. 1.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The main Objection, That it is againſt the Civil Power. Common Senſe and Experience confutes it. The more a Chriſtian the better Subject. The Chriſtians ſupported <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Crown. <hi>Sect. 3, 4.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They did not want Power to do otherwiſe; nor conſequently Integrity, as is objected, <hi>Sect. 5.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſay they were Fools, is more plauſible to the Age, but then the Empire muſt be ſo too; who were equally ignorant of theſe deſtructive Conſequences to their Government, <hi>Sect. 6.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſon of the preſent Miſunderſtandings, and that we do not ſee as the Ancients did; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Government own'd but that which is Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and outwardly Coercive, <hi>Sect. 7.</hi>

                     <hi>Grotius</hi> is in this Error, but oft corrects him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. His Inconſtancy is to be lamented; He imputes it to his Education.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48150:104"/>
as the World came into the Church, Believers were made, the Harveſt grew great, and there needed more Labourers to be ſent forth into it; a Power, I ſay, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the uſe of others, the advantage of Mankind, in the Succeſſions of it; not for one ſingle Purpoſe and Action, as were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Commiſſions and Delegations both before and under the Law, and one at the entrance of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> That given to St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> but to erect a new and ſtanding Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and this to continue till the World is no more, and then only is the Kingdom to be delivered up to the Father, whoſe <hi>is the Kingdom and the Power and the Glory, for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.

Our Saviour, who knew all things, who had the full deſign of his Father in his Head, and before him, knew alſo the ſeveral Accidents and Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies that would befall the Church, and his Wiſdom provided ſuitably; he did not leave his Church, as the Oſtrich in <hi>Job</hi> did her young ones, that every foot might cruſh and kill them; nor did he Build upon thoſe Sands either, that every Wind which blows, and Storm which deſcends, could deſtroy her, and which he muſt have done if founding his Church purely in Subordination to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Arm, to the Wills and Paſſions of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which Experience tells us, how various, how mutable, and diſorderly they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been; even the beſt of them, has but the breath in his Noſtrils; and yet even the

worſt of them, the greateſt, and a ſucceſſion too, of Tyrants, has never been able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve this Community, to eraſe its Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To erect a Body ſolitary and alone, without its own Laws, and a ſtrength, that is ſingular, to ſubſiſt and be Ruled by a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, and that is extraneous to it, is in courſe to be ſwallow'd up, throughly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorpt thereby. And 'tis again as bad or worſe, where every private Member is not obliged to ſuch its own Conſtitutions, and Juriſdictions, this is Anarchy and Confuſion, which God cannot be the Author of; the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety muſt on theſe terms equally diſſolve and periſh, be as liable to Invaſions as before. Our Saviour therefore erected his Corporation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent to the Secular Power, but depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and in ſubordination, as to its own Members, and to one another; and if any be unruly, and do not ſubmit, to the Laws of their Body, ſome of which are unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and as the Sun, for evermore; others occaſional, and in the Prudence and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the preſent Governors, Penal Laws, Abſtentions, Interminations, Exciſion it ſelf is to follow, the Church Cenſures moſt juſtly paſs upon them; nor ought they to have any benefit of that Body, can they indeed, if ſuch diſorders permitted, which they ſo rent in pieces, and which by ſuch their Rebellions, in courſe muſt decay, be rendred unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to themſelves and others.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48150:106"/>
is notorious to the common Senſes; nor is there any one Demonſtration carries more Evidence along with it; 'tis as plainly and legibly ſet before our Eyes, as Chriſt Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, was before the Eyes of the <hi>Galatians, Gal.</hi> 3.1. upon the common Senſe, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional conveyance of Mankind, as evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen from one to another, by handing it downwards, as thoſe particular Perſons who ſtood under the Croſs, did ſee and behold Chriſt diſtended and dying upon it; and yet ſo fooliſh and bewitched were thoſe very <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> as to diſſent from, and make of none effect Chriſt Crucified unto them; and there are of the ſame unhappy temper ſtill amongſt us, that deny and exclude this Succeſſion of Church-Power now, and in whom to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and undeceive. By anſwering ſuch Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they produce in their own behalf, is what I am in the next place to undertake. Their grand Objection runs thus. To aſſert a Church-Power independent, and reſiding in differing Subjects, from that of the State, muſt be a reſtraint to the Civil Power, or that Power of the State, to erect an Autority againſt it; becauſe not of, and under it; that Prince cannot be ſaid to be Supreme, if a differing Power within him; To be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme is to be above all, there muſt be no Power apart from his, who is the Supreme, if ſo, he is not Supreme. This they urge with a great deal more to the ſame purpoſe, and is the Stone that the great <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> ſtumbles at, in the entrance to his Treatiſe, <hi>De jure Summarum Poteſtatum in Sacris,</hi> and which occaſions ſo many more falls he has all
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48150:107"/>
along in that Diſcourſe; it being ſtuffed with inconſiſtencies to it ſelf throughout; and no wonder, when bottomed on ſo falſe a Principle, that the Power of our Saviour is an Uſurpation on the State; nor does one abſurdity go alone. A Suſpition upon Church-Government that has not the Honor to be new, 'tis as old as our Saviour in the Fleſh, and <hi>Herod</hi> we know ſtarted it againſt him ſo ſoon as Born in the World, and his Title as King was known unto him; for this he ſought to kill him when an Infant, and the little Children in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> were barbarouſly Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, hoping the Babe <hi>Jeſus</hi> might have died in the croud; diſtruſting, if he eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, he would have ſupplanted him of his Kingdom. Nor did his Apoſtles after him, eſcape the Suſpition and Cenſure; and yet, our Saviour all along his life-time upon Earth, and notoriouſly at his death, ſtill clear'd himſelf of the Aſperſion, aſſerting and maintaining his Power and Kingdom de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him of the Father, that <hi>All Power</hi> in Heaven and Earth; and ſo did his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles too, retain and exerciſe the ſame Power, and with the ſame Innocency. Nor do I doubt but to Vindicate his Body the Succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church, ſtill claiming the like Power, and that to every rational conſidering Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to each one, that with <hi>Herod,</hi> has not a deſign, and believes it his intereſt, to kill our Saviour, to blot out his Power, and Name and Memory on Earth.</p>

Can any, even a Phariſaical race of Men, ill-natur'd and Perverſe, give out and believe, That, that Body of Chriſtians, their Biſhops and Governors, ſhould Aſſert and Maintain a Kingdom and Juriſdiction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, deſtructive to that of the Empire, or Secular, by whoſe breath, they in their Perſons profeſſed to ſubſiſt; for whoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

and Government, and the Proſperity of both, they always Pray'd; and in the firſt place, as by whoſe Influences they were to live Godly lives, in all Godlineſs and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, whoſe Battels they fought, whom they Honoured with all the titles of Power, and Majeſty, and Magnificence, whom but to think Evil of, to Curſe in their Hearts, in their Bed-Chambers, much more openly to Defame and ſpeak Evil of, was their Sin and Irreligion, whom they acknowledged upon Earth, as under God alone, and to God alone accountable for all their Actions and Deſigns, nor could any Man ſay what doeſt thou? And all this they ſtill Remonſtrated and Publiſh'd to the World, under the deepeſt ſenſe of Religion and Zeal, with the moſt ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, as in all their Apologies, Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Writings does appear; who made it a term of their Communion, to Serve, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and Aſſiſt the Emperor; to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Faithful and Juſt, and Conſcientious towards him, equally as to ſerve their God and Saviour, as to ſay their Prayers for themſelves, and live Righteouſly and Sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the World; and the contrary was a juſt occaſion for their Cenſures, an Intermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon the Offender, who too often died under their Tyranny, came peaceably to the Stake, neither accuſing nor reviling, as under the ſtroke of God himſelf, ſealing with their Blood, ſuch their Obedience. Nor in all our firſt Church-Story do we find the Catholick Chriſtian engaged in any thing like a Plot, or Council, againſt his Governor, his either Perſon or Power; much leſs an
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48150:108"/>
open Rebel againſt him, when either an Heathen or Heretick, and his profeſſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor; for an Heretick has been no leſs Cruel than an Heathen: and when to make up the Charge by their Malice, as in the particular caſe of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> accuſed, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning againſt the Empire by the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Meletians,</hi> to be accuſed was his great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to be under the Suſpition of ſo foul a Crime, being otherways able to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo he did; and indeed ſo generally received a Truth was it, that a Chriſtian could not be a Rebel, or attempt any thing upon the Empire. So much was it concluded of the Eſſence of his Profeſſion, that when his Enemies thought effectually to blemiſh, and make him appear no Chriſtian, they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell'd him as a Rebel; the more and the better a Chriſtian, the more did his Prince confide in him, and 'tis very well urg'd by our Adverſaries, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did look upon them as his great Support and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; nor could the Empire in all Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have been continued to him, without their Aid and Fidelity; and for which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Temporalities, were deſervedly large unto them; but this is their Error when they tell the World, that all Church-Power was then, and is ſtill, continued upon this ſcore, and by the alone favour of Princes.</p>
               <p>IF it be ſaid that all this was the effect <label type="milestone">

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:48150:109"/>
wanting both of Power and Opportunity to do otherwiſe; and had it not been ſo, the Hypocriſie had ceaſed, they had both appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and acted, as their Principle of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Power, receiv'd of the Lord Jeſus, did influence and in courſe ſuggeſt unto them, ſet up againſt and oppoſe the Empire. So <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan</hi> and <hi>Knox</hi> give the reaſon, why the Apoſtles did not Mutiny and Rebel for the Goſpel, as they did in <hi>Scotland;</hi> becauſe they wanted Power, had neither Force, nor Opportunity as had they. And the ſame was the uſual Plea, of our Presbyterian Claſſical Men, both in their Pulpits and Printed Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, in defence of their Rebellions Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt; and too many of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors urge the ſame for the Maintenance of the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> Omnipotency, laying claim to both Swords; the wielding and executing both Governments, and diſpoſing of the Kingdoms of Princes, from a Donation and Right by Chriſt Jeſus. To which my Anſwer is, That whatever particular deſigning Sects may have aſſerted or done, and which I cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be engaged to defend; nor need I attempt their Confutation, where the Plea in it ſelf is ſo Notorious and Criminal, to urge and conclude theſe things againſt theſe Primitive Profeſſors and Doctors of the Church, againſt the Apoſtles themſelves, to ſuggeſt againſt and implead them of, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and unſincere Dealings, underhand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Actings, againſt the moſt frequent Proteſtations to the contrary, where no one outward, overt Act has appear'd, or but col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral

They thus through Ignorance and Inadvertency of the deſigns of our Saviour, uſurp'd a Power and Regiment in the Church that was never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for, nor committed to them; and then through the ſame Ignorance, and ſuper-added Zeal, farther aſſerted and defended it, not ſeeing the abſurd and ill conſequences at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, the infinite unlimitedneſs of that Power, the vaſter force and influence of ſuch their Principles, graſping in all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatſoever, giving Laws and Rules to

the Empire, when improved as it will bear, and more cunning Heads take it into their hands, have their particular Intereſts and Deſigns to ſerve upon, and maintain by it. But all this admitted, that the then Clergy were ſo ſtupid and ſottiſh, ſerving only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Zeal and Ignorance, its Mother, that there was not one wiſe Man among them, to foreſee, and conſider, and determine, and which, with leſs Perſwaſions may be done, we can endure this Scandal upon our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faith, we contend too uſually to have it ſo; what! was it ſo with the Laity too? with the Emperors themſelves, their Court and Senate? or was it reſerved alone for Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> and ſome few more of their Adherents, to ſee in ſuch Cauſes, theſe fatal and noxious Effects? That a Church-Government, derived from Chriſt, independent to that which is Temporal, is not only an Uſurpation in it ſelf, but upon all Civil Government alſo, that theſe two are wholly inconſiſtent, and can no ways ſtand together?

diſcourſe of their Prerogative; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly their Care and Proviſion, in reſpect of Church-men was great and Eminent, that no Damage return to the Crown, upon any Pleas of Exemptions, or Priviledges derived from them. How ſevere they were in limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in their Ordinations, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved; that, by any Exceſſive Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of that ſpecial Power, acknowledged in the Biſhops alone, and ſtill remov'd from themſelves, the State might not be weakned, it being it ſeems too uſual for Men of great Fortunes, and ſufficient Abilities otherways, to Serve their Prince in his Wars or other Secular Imployments, to come into the Church, and receive Holy Orders, only to exempt themſelves for the advantage of thoſe Freedoms and Immunities inveſted in the Clergy, to crowd under the Church's Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for Eaſe and Idleneſs. And therefore the Biſhops were forbad to Conſecrate any ſuch Perſons, and many other ſuch like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions are to be ſeen in the Imperial Laws and Conſtitutions. I'le inſtance in one or two of them. As that the <hi>Jews</hi> when Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and under bad Circumſtances, turn'd Chriſtians only for Favour and an eaſier diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in the Courts of Juſtice, were not to be received into the Church, nor imbodied among the Chriſtians; Nor Servants and Debtors, which fled to the Altar to avoid their Maſters and Creditors; and the Clergy that received them were firſt to be depoſed, and then to be delivered over to the Civil Power, for farther Puniſhment, <hi>Cod.</hi> 9. <hi>Theodoſ. l. l.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

But this will not do, the ground of the Quarrel has really another bottom, and their Reaſons are another thing; as muſt be obvious to him that is converſant with the Writings either of the Principal Authors of theſe new ſtarted Opinions, or ſuch as were accidentally only their occaſion, or after Abettors of them. They cannot ſee, nor aſſent to any Government, as exiſting in the World; but what is viſible and ſenſible, has

its Operations and Effects upon outward Senſe, and its Organs, upon the Perſon or Eſtate, the Life or Bodily Action of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and this to be preſently inflicted.

We have above obſerved, That <hi>Herod</hi> the King, was the firſt Man that ſuggeſted this great Error, and that the Kingdom of our Saviour muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant and aboliſh the Kingdoms of this World, his Power and <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s could not ſtand together.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>VIII</label> Pamphlets that went about of this Nature in 1641. 'Twas the Deſign of that time to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinge and overthrow every thing well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and the Argument was leſs odious, that began with the Church and its Power, particularly I have by me a ſmall Treatiſe which came forth in that year, call'd <hi>The true Grounds of Eccleſiaſtical Regiment,</hi> &amp;c. but the Title within is, <hi>The Divine Right of Epiſcopacy refuted,</hi> the more to ingage the Reader; for Epiſcopacy was firſt to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and he had the moſt advantage to do it, it being the particular quarrel; but the after-game was at all Church-Power in general, and which he endeavours to eraſe upon this ſcore, as againſt the <hi>Soveraign Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Kings,</hi> for which he ſeems Zealous, when to Dethrone Church-men, but at laſt ſets a Thouſand more upon the Throne with him, his <hi>Princes in Parliament,</hi> as he calls them; nay, he ſets them above the King, and ſays, though to <hi>Princes on their lawful Tribunals, ſomething is more due than at other times; but to Princes ſomething is more due than at other times, but to Princes in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48150:115"/>
there is moſt of all due; all Power being not derived to the King without them, and whoſe Eccleſiaſtical Power he there diſcourſes.</hi> And which I therefore here repeat, to ſhew what was deſigned for our Kings by theſe Men, when ſo much Pleading for a Power belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them which is the Church's; and his chief Argument all along againſt Church-Power, independent to Princes, is, that it is not like, nor does it enter into any Riva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with that ſolid, ſenſible, coercive Power wherewith God has inveſted his true Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants upon Earth; and therefore is it but Imaginary and Improper. That Power which is proper, muſt include not only a Power of Commanding, but alſo an effectual Virtue of forcing Obedience to its Commands, and of ſubjecting and reducing ſuch as ſhall not render themſelves obedient; that, as among the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Church and State was the ſame, had the ſame Body, the ſame Head, the ſame Sword; and that Head was Temporal, and that Sword was Material; and therefore 'tis ſo with Chriſtians, nor have they any Sword or Head that is Spiritual. Chriſtians ought not to be ſo contrary to that excellent Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which God himſelf or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and to introduce I know not what Spiritual Rule, in prejudice of Temporal Rule; nor does he expect any Satisfaction from his Adverſaries, why there ſhould be leſs Diviſion betwixt Church and State, among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and leſs uſe of two ſeveral Swords; and becauſe Adultery was Puniſh'd with Death, Chriſtians ought not to be Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for it. If God has given them
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:48150:115"/>
ſole Knowledge to Determine all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and Power to Enact all Eccleſiaſtical Canons, doubtleſs he has given them ſome binding Coercive force correſpondent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and if ſo, why do they not expel all Diſſention by it? If their Virtue extend no further than to Exhortation, why do they urge Commands upon us? If they have a Commanding Power, why do they not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond it with due Compulſion? it is plainly clear'd to us, that Adultery by God's Law was Puniſh'd by the Temporal not Spiritual Sword; and that the <hi>Abſciſſio animae</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> was only Corporal Puniſhment by Death, the infliction whereof was only left to the Temporal Magiſtrate; and that there was no difference obſerved between Crimes Spiritual and Crimes Temporal. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there ought to be none in the Church of Chriſt; the form or eſſence of Law, is that Coercive or Penal Virtue by which it binds all to its Obedience; if Prieſts had any ſuch Spiritual Sword, doubtleſs it would have ſome ſenſible Efficacy, and work to good Ends, and Men would not, nor could not chooſe, but bow and ſubmit themſelves under it.

And if he concludes any thing at all, and which is not eaſily ſeen, it is this, That a Biſhop is ſo far from having a diſtinct Power above a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, ſolitary and apart from him; that he has neither <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in general, no Government nor Juriſdiction at all. And the reaſon he backs it with is this, Chriſt did not inveſt his Apoſtles with the Power of worldly and civil Magiſtrates, when he ſent them out to Preach. If ſo, he ſhould have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to them ſo many Lictors and Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, furniſhed them with Whips and Axes; and not having done it, there is no Magiſtracy at all, nothing of Power reſiding, becauſe able to engage none by Violence; neither Corporal nor Pecuniary Mulcts can be infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by them. And ſo in his Diſſertation <hi>De Epiſcopis &amp; Presbyteris contra Petavium,</hi> under the Name of <hi>Walo Meſſalinus,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Epiſcopacy to be <hi>Curatio</hi> only, and which he diſtinguiſhes <hi>à Magiſtratu, Poteſtate &amp; Imperio,</hi> from all ſorts of Government. And ſays expreſly, That any Jurisdiction of one Clergy-man above another came from <hi>Conſtantine, Cap.</hi> 6. and ſo Zealous is he to make Epiſcopacy but an Humane Diſpoſition, that he delivers it as his Opinion, and takes a great deal of pains to prove it, That the Presbyters themſelves, are no other than <hi>Lay-men,</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:48150:118"/>
have nothing of a Diſtinction, or of a Power different from the Laity, as the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of old had amongſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> That as Lay-men did Baptize, as well as any, and which is acknowledged, ſo that Biſhops and Presbyters do Adminiſter the Sacraments of Chriſt, 'tis only as dedicated to it, by the choice of the People, and in whoſe abſence Laicks may Conſecrate all Believers, and not only the Apoſtles, receiving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Power at Chriſt's Inſtitution; and ſuitably was it done in every Family, and after Supper, for ſome Ages; and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the Order Eccleſiaſtical, and the People in common, has nothing of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution. That Ordination by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, gives nothing at all of new Power; only ranks them in ſuch a Body and Order, as Firſt, Second and Third. And the Door-Keepers have as much a place and order in the Church, as either Deacon, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter or Biſhop; the Biſhop and Presbyter were only the more Honorable and Honeſt part of the People. And thus he brings in his Lay-Elders to have an equal Right and Government in Church Matters with them, by a Primitive Devolution, and which Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers once were in every Church, but now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only in the <hi>Affrican,</hi> though with the addition of the Order of Presbyters, for which there is no footſtep in the Primitive Apoſtolical Church. And at laſt is angry with <hi>Petavius,</hi> that he perſtringes the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> becauſe they retained no Prieſthood at all, under the Goſpel; but believe that juſt and faithful Laicks may do
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:48150:119"/>
all that is needful in the Church of God, and diſcharge every Eccleſiaſtical Office, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Power by the Impoſition of the hands of the Presbytery; that is, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate not Eccleſiaſtical but Laick; in which whether <hi>Petavius</hi> injures the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> or not, is not the matter now to be enquired after; ſure it is, <hi>Salmaſius</hi> adopts theſe their imputed Opinions, and they are his. And he thinks it the Mind of St. <hi>Peter</hi> too, whom he cites, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. calling the Laicks that are faithful, <hi>an Holy Prieſthood,</hi> to offer Spiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God through Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>a Royal Prieſthood, Ibid.</hi> and all which <hi>Petavius</hi> the Jeſuite makes no ſmall advantage of, to the Infamy of the Reformation. Neither have I done <hi>Claudius Salmaſius</hi> any injury in ranking him among thoſe that deny all Church-Power as from Chriſt Jeſus; for he is worſe than thoſe I have mentioned before him, he takes the civil aſſignation from the hands of the Prince, and puts it into the People. So that every Man may as well Ordain himſelf; as in the days of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> And hence we cannot but take notice with what furious, inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, malicious purpoſes ſome Men have purſued Epiſcopacy, and rather than have it ſtand, they'l fall themſelves, deny what is otherwiſe their <hi>Diana</hi> and great Delight, the Divine Right of Presbytery, take away all Church-Power for ever with it; And indeed the Principles that theſe Men go upon are ſuch, when to throw down Epiſcopacy, that they ſtrike at our whole Chriſtianity with the ſame blow, as does his Friend <hi>David

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48150:120"/>
then which, what more can be deſired by us, and how conſiſtent with himſelf any one may ſee. I'le only add the words of our Profound Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Laws of the Church,</hi> p. 395. <hi>He that in his Preface to his Annotations on the Goſpel ſhall read him diſclaiming whatever the Conſent of the Church ſhall be found to refuſe, will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he had admitted no Corporation of the Church, without which, no Conſent thereof, could have been obſerved.</hi> And 'tis, I ſay, from theſe his Annotations on the Goſpels, we are to find and know what are his Sentiments; if any where, he deſires us to have recourſe hither, if we will read his other things with Profit, in his Preface to the Reader. Now, that thoſe above cited Treatiſes in which his Errors as to Church-Government are ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, were all wrote when he was young, 'tis certain; and that he was too much pre-occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated and prejudiced by his Education and particular Converſe and Buſineſs at <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> in ſuch his Youth, follows in courſe, and himſelf was afterwards ſenſible of, and lamented it throughout his whole Life. And thinks it leſs Candid and Ingenious in <hi>Andrew Rivette,</hi> that he objects thoſe things againſt him, that he had wrote ſome times ſince, <hi>Cum illi multarum rerum conſpectum adimeret nimius Patriae amor; cùm eſſet Parvulus, loque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur ut Parvulus;</hi> when the over-much love to his Country, did take from him the ſight of many things. When he was a Child, he wrote as a Child, <hi>Rivet. Apol. Diſcuſſ. Pag.</hi> 732. And it muſt be alſo very harſh and ſevere in us, ſhould we object againſt him
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48150:121"/>
that his particular Treatiſe <hi>of the Power of the Supreme Magiſtrate in Holy Things,</hi> which that it is a Poſthumous work 'tis moſt apparent. And farther, That he diſown'd it when it was wrote, and never deſign'd it for the Preſs, 'tis more then probable; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we give Credit to what account our <hi>Herbert Thorndike</hi> gives of it, in his <hi>Laws of the Church,</hi> the laſt Chapter, That at his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>England,</hi> he left it with two great Prelates of our Church, <hi>Lancelot</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> to peruſe; and both of them adviſing him not to Print it, he reſted in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and 'twas laid aſide till his Death. And indeed, that that Treatiſe was not the iſſue of a fixed Judgment, but to ſerve a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, appears from the unevenneſs of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, contradicting it ſelf frequently, and contending againſt the very deſign of it; the great Argument of a raw imperfect confuſed Notion. And particularly, if we conſider, he was every ways an adherent to the <hi>Holland</hi> Remonſtrants, a ſort of Men, that in Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Church, ſo extremely flatter'd the Civil Magiſtrate; as our Author makes it appear, <hi>Ibid. ſuprà;</hi> though he never drank ſo deep of the Cup, as to take off the Dregs, as he himſelf farther pleads to <hi>Rivet,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome Presbyterian Tenents, imbibed in his Youth, <hi>Ibid. ſuprà,</hi> and acknowledges much to the Mercies of God, that when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed round with their ſo great Power, he could never be brought to Approve that which is proper to Calviniſts, <hi>Ibid.</hi> And how eaſily theſe things ſlide into Mankind, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48150:121"/>
they work, and how difficultly caſt off, Experience too much Evidences; The Natural Love to a man's Country, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his Education, the higher Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it, its Applauſe and Acclamations: All which <hi>Grotius</hi> had in a great meaſure. The latter alone is able to ſpoil a Judgment; it muſt do it, where entertained and purſued: and though he that reads over <hi>Grotius,</hi> and ſays he is not the better for him, ſuch is his excellent and incomparable Notion, muſt be either a great Fool, or very ill natur'd; yet 'tis to be doubted ſome of theſe never quitted him quite, his Theological Works, lately Printed together, give too great a Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> ſomewhere or other being to be found in them, and every one may pick out, or very near it, his own Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. So fatal is it, for Men of great Parts to ſet out, without ſome firſt Principles, as he did, and frame their Scheme of Divinity to the preſent Notion and Conception, no regard had to ſomething receiv'd, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. So in courſe does it follow, what in him is to be found, and nothing could have done him ſo much right, as, in the ſetting out of his Works, to have given account to the World, of the particular time, when they were each of them Compoſed, and firſt made Publick. All that I ſhall add more concerning <hi>Grotius,</hi> is this, In the purſuance of his aſſumed Notion of <hi>Supreme,</hi> laid down by him in the Entrance to his Treatiſe <hi>De Imperio ſummarum Poteſtatum in Sacris,</hi> and which is the chief occaſion of his following Miſtakes. As, <hi>To be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:48150:122"/>
is to be above all, indefinitely in the full Latitude of things, and where fixed and attributed to any one Perſon or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the very Deſign and Nature of the Expreſſion, will allow none to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, or exempted from a Submiſſion and Subjection; no other Power can be ſuppoſed, and not in Subordinacy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency upon, to be and ſubſiſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and beſides it. He is ſo unhappy, as to fall into and purſue the ſame Miſtake, the Jeſuit had done in Doctor <hi>Bilſon</hi>'s Book of <hi>Chriſtian Subjection, and Obedience,</hi> in the Second Part, who there thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues againſt the Oath of Supremacy. <q>If Princes be Supreme Governors over all Perſons in all Cauſes; then in vain did the Holy Ghoſt appoint Paſtors and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to govern the Church, then are they Superior to Chriſt himſelf, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect being Chriſt's Maſters; then may they preſcribe which way to Worſhip God.</q> And goes on a little farther, and declares his diſlike to <hi>Supreme</hi> in the Oath, becauſe, that word maketh Princes Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to God himſelf, for <hi>Supreme</hi> is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to all; neither Chriſt's own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor his Church excepted. Now, I ſay, this one and the ſame Notion of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and the Jeſuit, if adhered unto, and both will continue to allow it; they are upon equal Grounds, and with the ſame advantage ſight againſt one another, and the Combat may be Eternal, only of Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes and ſome Blows; but no Victory on either ſide. When <hi>Grotius</hi> goes along with
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48150:122"/>
our Church of <hi>England,</hi> and makes his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate Supreme in all Cauſes, and over all Perſons, the Jeſuite tells him, That to be Supreme is above all, to be Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to all, and he ſets up his Prince above God and Chriſt, and the Church; when the Jeſuit aſſerts the Supreme Power of the Church of God, <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the ſame Ground replies the ſelf-ſame thing upon him. That he exalts the Church-Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove God and Chriſt, and the Magiſtrate, as all their Maſters. And indeed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe Mens Notions, to apply the Superlative to any Perſon or Thing, is the height of Blaſphemy. For why? God is not excepted. And the moſt common Phraſes, of a moſt Mighty Prince, a moſt Holy Place, a moſt Wiſe Counſellor, are all inſtances of it; nor can any one Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of Gods, be otherwiſe applyed to the Creature. Whereas, if the Word be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and uſed, as in common uſe it is to be, and in complyance with things it muſt be, ſuitable to the preſent Subject it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd and limited to, and the particular things it is converſant with, as under ſuch and ſuch Heads and Orders, all is eaſie and plain. Thus God is the alone <hi>Supreme,</hi> all Rule, Governance and Autority being originally in him and eminently. Chriſt is <hi>Supreme,</hi> as Head of the Church, to whom all Power is given of the Father, for bringing Mankind to Heaven; the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and their Succeſſors, the Paſtors of the Church, were and are now <hi>Supreme</hi> on Earth, in the ſame Power derived from Chriſt,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48150:123"/>
by the Apoſtles unto them. The Prince is <hi>Supreme,</hi> and hath all Power from God committed unto him; as to Government relating to this World; over all Things, Perſons and Cauſes, to appropriate or alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to Endow, Limit, Reſtrain, Coerce or Compel, as the alone Supreme Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver upon Earth, and none may oppoſe; and the great and gyant Objection, that is only wrangling about and miſtaking of words, falls to the ground, as it is in it ſelf nothing.</p>

We are told that all Puniſhments both before, and after, the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Law in <hi>Sinai,</hi> from <hi>Adam</hi> to Chriſt, were bodily and outwardly Coercive, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive, the diſtinction of Sins Spiritual and Temporal was not then known, nor was there any ſuch different Regiments and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, in regard to them; the Sword pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd Adulteries as well as Burglary. And therefore 'tis ſo ſtill under the Goſpel, by the Inſtitution of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; nor was there a Juriſdiction ſeparate and apart, relating alone to Spiritual Church Affairs, deſigned, or erected, by him. An Inference (granting the truth of the Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) ſurely as wide as their keeneſt Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can wiſh it to be, and the Conſequence had been every ways as due and firm, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that there were never any ſuch Levitical Rites, and Ceremonies given from God by him, ſuch a Polity erected, becauſe nothing like it, that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48150:127"/>
we know of, was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; nor is there one Rule, Law or Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſince given to his Succeſſion, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs in particular, but upon the ſame force and account, muſt ſtill be exemplary, nor ought there, can there be, any inſtitution that is diverſe from them received; if a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Power, from all the World before him, be admitted and allowed in <hi>Moſes</hi> the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, much more in Chriſt a Son over his own Houſe, by whom God hath ſpoken to us in theſe laſt days, as in times paſt he did <hi>to the Fathers, by the Prophets, whom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Heir of all things; by whom alſo he hath made the worlds; who is the bright Image of his Perſon, upholding all things by the word of his Power,</hi> Heb. 1.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. who had greater Autority, more full and larger In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Commiſſion, and more ſignally evidenced to the outward ſenſe of Mankind, than any Prophets or Meſſengers of Gods had before, who had all Power in Heaven and Earth committed unto him, both ſpake and acted as never Man did. And in the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner did he gather and ſtabliſh and ſix his Church, or Body upon Earth; and at his going away into Heaven, ſend down his own Gifts in the face of all Nations at the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> erected his own Kingdom, appointed his own Officers, aſſign'd his own Members, influenced them by his own Spirit, governed them by his own Laws, aſſociated them in his own Method, and nothing of it was of this World. He made a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſtabliſh'd on better Grounds, incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with better Hopes and Promiſes, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48150:127"/>
new Ordinances, made new Seals and Conveyances, gave new Liveries, and Pledges that were diverſe, a Government to laſt for ever, till the reſtitution of all things, with a reſpect to nothing future, but Heaven, and all this abſolute in it ſelf, and independent, abſtract and ſeparate from any, or all the Powers and Aſſociations in the world beſide; complying and yielding to no one Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Exigence, or Neceſſity whatever; ſo contrived and ordained, that as himſelf, her Head, ſo the Church his Body, and every Member in particular hath life in it ſelf, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived only from him; their own Powers and Capacities, and Inſtitutions, and the gates of Hell are not to prevail againſt them; and then ſurely ſpecial Commands, and different Offences, may be allowed, there muſt be new Animadverſions and Corrections, Diſcipline and Puniſhments; and theſe in ſuch hands as is his Pleaſure. However, to infer, there is now no ſuch things, or in ſuch a manner, and ſuch hands, becauſe never in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is hugely inconcluding; nor do any Men that are in earneſt, or out of a Plot, believe, or declare themſelves any otherwiſe obliged by ſuch the forementioned Inſtances and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, whether in Law or Government, any farther than the Parity of Reaſon, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency of things enforce and engage; and there would be mad work were it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Only Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> and his Friends, are, it ſeems, to be excepted, who thus argue, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> for their Offences againſt God, had a civil Baniſhment. <hi>Achan</hi>'s Body and all his Goods were a devoted thing for
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48150:128"/>
his Sacriledge. Others were Slain or Stoned, or ſwallowed up by the Earth for their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Impieties, Excommunication was not at all amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> for ſome time, and ſince, it was received only as a Compact among themſelves to keep their People in awe and order, when they were in Captivity, and without the benefit of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and their Penal Laws to correct and reſtrain them. And therefore there are not, neither ought to be, any other Puniſhments under the Goſpel; All the Anathema's, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votings, Cuttings off, Separation, Abſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Interminations, Excommunications, are nothing elſe. The Primitive Chriſtians, without any Pre-obligation from Chriſt, upon the ſame ſcore entred into their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and govern'd themſelves alſo as they could, while the Empire was Heathen; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not capable any otherways to ſubſiſt, keep their Body together and Protect it, and which ceaſed when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who took it all into his own hands, managed it as occaſion, and as he pleaſed; in whom, by right, alone it reſided. And the Argument is every whit as good, as to Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper, which were imitations of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cuſtoms; and that there is no more in either, than was in their Baptizing and Waſhing when they made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, or in their Cup of Bleſſing, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Health, Eating and Banquetting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and which muſt be in the Power of the Supreme Magiſtrate, to cancel or continue at his Pleaſure. And much wider yet is a farther Concluſion of his in his Twelfth
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48150:128"/>
Chapter, That there was no Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> nor is therefore to be any among Chriſtians, becauſe no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, in an old <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Manuſcript Ritual, which he has by him, and there produces; and the courſes of Penance and Repentance, are all Innovations, becauſe his Prieſt of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> neither knew nor diſcovered any thing of it; and which muſt be the alone Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from all his great Pains and Reading there ſhew'd to the World, if there can be any at all. And indeed, had he not intended more to amuſe the World with a bulk of Stuff and Reading, as is his uſual way, and by a confuſion of things firſt to confound his Reader, the eaſier to impoſe upon him, the uſual way of all Hereticks, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> has obſerv'd <hi>Adverſus Praxean Cap.</hi> 20. <hi>Proprium eſt omnium Hereticorum, pauca adverſus plura defendunt, &amp; poſteriora adverſus priora. Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis tanquam ad Croeſum &amp; Pyrrhum Loxias;</hi> as <hi>Marius Mercator</hi> of the <hi>Pelagian;</hi> Firſt, to involve and entangle; he would have omitted all theſe Impertinencies, and gone directly to the Buſineſs, As whether ſuch a Kingdom was once erected? Such Power was left upon Earth or not? and this indeed he attempts, but 'tis in the After-Game, the Buſtle, and Diſtraction. And he does it only too in compliance with his own falſe Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He conſiders nothing of the Kingdom of Chriſt, the Nature of his Commiſſion, it's Power, Reaſons, Deſign, End and Reward, he wreſts particular paſſages of Scripture, to his perverted purpoſe, and I'le bring as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Readings and Expoſitions with their tricks
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48150:129"/>
and turnings, quite againſt him. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly intermixes and confounds the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, eſpecial Actions of the Apoſtles, when inflicting Death and Temporal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the Teſtimony of their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and terror to the preſent Offendor, and warning to future Ages, and which were to ceaſe, with that ſetled fixed Power of theirs, deſign'd for a Perpetuity. And his Miſtake is as great in his numerous Inſtances of the Imperial Acts and their Conſtitutions; of their Titles of <hi>Epiſcopus Epiſcoporum, Summus Pontifex,</hi> and the Application of them, all which are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and which is already ſhew'd. The Power of the Church, purely as ſuch, and which is alone the Subject of the Debate, is entire and within it ſelf, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and maintained; but never invaded, by the Titles and Acts Imperial. Nor need all be let paſs, as for granted, that he thinks himſelf ſo ſecure of, as an unſhaken Medium, for his undue gathered Concluſion. And certainly there was more than a Bodily Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Puniſhment in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> a ſingle Puniſhment was not all they had inflicted on, or was intended to them, there was a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding ſomething Spiritual too; a Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at leaſt, of inward Strength and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, a turning out from ſome other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Advantages and Enjoyments, and which is imported, by the turning out from the Preſence of God, and the change of the Earth, was not the alone Deprivation. And ſure I am, we have as good Grounds that it was more, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> has produced to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, (though his Enumerations are great,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48150:129"/>
and his little Autorities are many; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he does nothing but what is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in that Senſe,) did the clearing the preſent Truth any ways depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p n="2">2.That then which will be more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> is this, and which renders an evident account, why all the Offences, under the Levitical Diſpenſation, were puniſhable on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Civil Power, and with Temporal Awards, and by one and the ſame hand of Juſtice, the diſtinction between Sins Spiritual and Temporal, were leſs obvious, or none; and the Power of the Prieſthood was not ſo diſtinct and apart, and yet no neceſſity of the like Conſtitution, in any one inſtance now under Chriſtianity; the principal reaſon of all, I ſay, ſeems to be this. The great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparity betwixt the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as to their particular Form and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; the Jewiſh Church was imbodied in the State in the deſign and frame of it; and the Laws of both were one and the ſelf-ſame Law of the Nation, the Government was blended, and ſo mixed together, that is, was all one Polity, diſperſed by the hands of the Prieſts and Levites and Judges of the Gates, each had their original ſhare; and the ſo much magnified <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> is allowed to be of the ſame Complexion, or mixed multitude together, and united for preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And hence is it, as Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> ſays very well, That when a Conquer'd People and in Captivity, under the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Foreign Power, and which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd not their Religion, it had no Power to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48150:130"/>
Protect it ſelf; and therefore by Compact among themſelves, they ſubmitted to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. A Politick accidental Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of their own, to keep themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The Offices of the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, though appropriate and diſtinct as to ſome Acts and Powers, yet not as to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they, as ſuch, were placed only in the Services of the Tabernacle, the Temple and Altar. And <hi>Grotius</hi> well deſcribes them, <hi>Judices erant de arduis Legis, ut viri caeteris Eruditiores,</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.9. They executed the Offices of Judges, as Men more Skilled and Learned than others; it flowed not pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their Prieſtly Delegation. That Power came another way, perhaps as Elected into the <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> if there was ſuch a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Society for Government, which from the Old Teſtament appears not, however in uſe in the days of our Saviour. And which makes me admire ſome Men among us, who contend ſo much for the letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and run down whatever is Tradition beſides it; and yet ſo much adore their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified <hi>Sanedrim,</hi> upon the alone talk of ſome Jewiſh Doctors which were but of Yeſterday. And it was a great Error in <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> and argued in him more Zeal than Judgment; who, in anſwer to this Part of <hi>Eraſtus</hi> in his forementioned Hundred Theſes, aſſerts the Jewiſh Church and State to have been two Bodies, with different Powers for Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And who is followed herein by <hi>Matthew Sutcliffe, De Presbyterio,</hi> and others; beſides the very Stipulation and Compact betwixt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> was for the Temporal <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:48150:130"/>
upon Temporal Promiſes and Rewards, the Milk and Honey, and quiet Poſſeſſion of it; Nor did the Levitical Covenant as ſuch engage for any more. Whatever good things to come, were expected by the more diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of them, they receiv'd another way. By accidental occaſional Notices, they ſaw in the Glaſs, through the Veil, in the Type and Shadow (for ſo the Law was in the Plot and Deſign to be unto them,) or by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Advantages of the Prophets which God all along ſent unto them, whoſe Buſineſs it was, at leaſt a great part of it, farther to reveal, unfold, and diſcover the End and Purport of the Law unto them, and whoſe report was very hardly believed: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, as were their Covenant, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentment; ſo were their Awards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In courſe they were to be Bodily and Temporal, no wonder that Adultery was Puniſh'd by the Sword, and they quite cut off from that good Land, as it afterwards happened unto them. So Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Jews, Qui ob Praeſentia tantum bona, Legis praecepta cuſtodiunt, ut terrenae Foelicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis &amp; longae vitae Praemium conſequuntur— Qui te ob praeſentia tantum rerum promiſſa venerantur, Ep.

alone Nomothetical, and to oblige as a Law. And ſo we find this one Reaſon of that one Branch of the Law which conſiſts in Sacrifices (not excluding that which is Typical of it) as a tryal of the <hi>Jews</hi> Obedience to God, that the Bleſſing of the Covenant may be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued unto them, <hi>Quâ Populum pronum in Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latriam &amp; Tranſgreſſionem ejuſmodi Officiis Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioni ſuae voluit adſtringere.

The Advantage by their Scheme and Objection, as drawn up, is on our ſide; and we thence claim theſe following Concluſions, which no Man, as in themſelves, can deny; though in their thwartings, as to the Deſign of our Adverſaries, and compliance with ours, they are bluſter'd againſt and miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>

And that the Goſpel might with leſs prejudice, and more readineſs be received at its Promulgation. And we have ſeveral Inſtances of this kind, both before, all along throughout, and the midſt of the Levitical Diſpenſation. Such as were not of the Deſcent of <hi>Abram</hi> were ſtill taken in, and <hi>Gentiles</hi> admitted to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and not upon either the Levitical, or Abrahamitical Compact or Indentment.

                  </gap>, or <hi>Graecian</hi> Worſhippers amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> call'd Proſelytes of Righteouſneſs, known to every Body. This was one great end why Chriſt ſent his many Prophets early and late unto them, to take them off from the Carnal Services, to open and unfold the true and farther meaning of them, and in what reſpect they were enjoyned. That it was not the Sacrifice it ſelf and burnt Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, new Moons, Incenſe and Oblations, God then required, but Purity, Judgment and Humility, to obey the Voice of God.

Nature, they more ſenſibly and forcibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in order to it; diſinveſted them of their Temple, without which they would not have thought they could have lived one day, and ſo led them by the ſame Neceſſity, to that Worſhip, and Service and Form of Government, which in the Deſign and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God was to overſpread the whole Earth, and remain to the Reſtitution of all things. Thus came it about, that the Seventy and two <hi>Jews,</hi> themſelves Tranſlated the Holy Bible into Greek, the moſt known Language of the then civilized and learned Part of the World, and which at ſome times to have done was Piaculous; and what then this, could more tend to the Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> This occaſioned that Deſign of thoſe Pious Perſons, <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Book of Wiſdom,</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was, of drawing them off from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm, and inſtilling the Goſpel-Service and Obedience, which was by and by to ſucceed, and to be Eternal; whoſe devout moſt Holy Pens taking the advantage of their preſent Captivity, and forlorn State, without their Pompous carnal Ordinances, uncapable of the Temple Duties, inſtructed and urg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that Religion, which the Accidents or Contingencies of the World could not deprive them the Exerciſe of. Neither time, nor Place, nor Perſon, could obſtruct the Performance, true Holineſs, Obedience, and Judgment to come; and which alone would bring them Peace at the laſt. And we may ſafely ſay, That in theſe Moral Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of theirs, there is, though not more
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48150:136"/>
of the Goſpel; yet it is more plain here, and open and intelligible, than in all the Books of the Old Teſtament beſide; what is there only in either Shades and Types, the Myſtical allegorical Senſe, or elſe upon the glance, and by accident, ſpoken, is here with open face, in the intent and purpoſe. And I may ſpeak it out, That the Reſurrection of the Body is ſo evidently Profeſſed by the Mother of the Seven Sons in the <hi>Maccabees, Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 7. that the like was not done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48150:137"/>
which has been made to appear all along in this Diſcourſe; and the Churches in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Alexandria, Antioch, Caeſarea, Rome,</hi> might all be, and were, of an Antecedent Inſtitution, though the Owning and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Empire was much to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; or why ſhould this be concluded againſt the Chriſtians, and not againſt the <hi>Jews?</hi> who are ſuppoſed to have inſtituted their own Diſcipline under the Captivity, before <hi>Judea</hi> was reduced to a Province, and they profeſſed Subjection to the Empire, and all along retain'd it, and all other Rites, or at leaſt ſo many of them as their conquer'd Condition did render them capable of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſing, as immediately from God, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent to the State; nor will any one ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to aſſert otherwiſe.

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48150:139"/>
Goſpel is not, cannot be outwardly forcing and Coercive, by the either Inſtruments or Penalties of this World. To aſſert ſuch a Power erected by our Lord and Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, is immediately and with the ſame breath, to publiſh it a Cheat, an Impoſture and Uſurpation, 'tis in the very letter to Affront and Contradict, the very Plot, Frame, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it, ſince Chriſt himſelf has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that his Kingdom is not of this World, neither laid in the contrivance, either ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd or ſupported in the ways and courſes of it. If it had been ſo, he had ſurely never appeared in the World in that meaner form and lower order he did, a different way then by dying upon the Croſs had been deſign'd for the managery and accompliſhment of it, he could have call'd for Fire from Heaven as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah</hi> did upon the Head of his Gain-ſayers, a courſe of Proceedings agreeable enough to that preſent Conſtitution, whoſe Rewards and Penalties were Carnal, in the hands of a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Juriſdiction, or have had Millions of Angels his Seconds, to ſmite, as they did <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army, in one Night, one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, all that oppoſed, that ſat in Judgment againſt him; or with but one word from his Mouth, laid any one gain-ſayer flat upon the ground; as he did thoſe few that came firſt to lay hold of him, when he was betrayed; He was not ſent into the World weak and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with leſs perfect Credentials and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or leſſer Power, than other Prophets or Holy Men had, which were ſent into the World before him, all was full and perfect, in order to the Meſſage and Embaſſy, the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48150:139"/>
Errand he came into the World for, he came with more, with all, Power in Heaven and Earth given him, the Power of the Kingdom wholly and ſolely delivered up unto him; only he came of a different Errand and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, than ſome others had come of before him, he was of another Spirit, and to work his work quite in another manner, and by other Weapons; not ſuch as were Carnal, but Spiritual, mighty indeed, to the beating down ſtrong holds, but of Sin and Sathan; he came not to deſtroy, but to ſave that which was loſt, to lay hold on the Seed of <hi>Abram,</hi> when he paſſed by the fallen Angels, leſt they come into their blackneſs of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thoſe Chains they are now reſerv'd in for Judgment. And let any one but ſeriouſly peruſe, and conſider this great Myſtery of Godlineſs; God manifeſt in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, Preach'd unto the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> believed on in the World, and received up into Glory, let him look over the Hiſtory of his Saviour, his firſt coming from Heaven, his whole Life, Actings, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, Dying, riſing again and aſcending into Heaven, and he can diſcern nothing like an outward ſenſible, worldly Regiment and Juriſdiction to be erected or executed by him, any outward force upon Mens either Perſons, or Lives or Fortunes, in bringing about that work he was ſent for into the World by the Father to do, is the intent and purpoſe of it; and as he had not, neither can he be conceived to have had, a deſign in his own Perſon to exerciſe a worldly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, or did he delegate others, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48150:140"/>
and principal Miniſters, to any ſuch Office and Undertakings; his being Preach'd to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and believed on in the World, implied or inferr'd nothing of it, but the quite contrary; nor could any be his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Followers, on any ſuch purpoſes. With an induſtrious Zeal he ſtill removed it out of the apprehenſions and thoughts of his Diſciples when on Earth among them; he told St. <hi>Peter</hi> he was an Offence to him, when ſavouring theſe things of Men, fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to reign as a Temporal Prince on Earth; with outward force and Power to repel the Injuries of his Adverſaries, St. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.21, 22, 23. As alſo when his Diſciples required him to call down Fire from Heaven upon the Heads of his Enemies in St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Goſpel, urging to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and all of them thoſe quite different Doctrines of his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, That if any man will come after him, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow him; that whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, and whoſoever will loſe his life, ſhall ſave it; and 'tis to ſave the Soul, not gain the World, is to be their aim in becoming his Diſciples. And thus did they Preach Chriſt ever ſince the Holy Ghoſt ſo fully came upon them; reproving the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and Judgment, the work of the Comforter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.7, 8. And that trifling Argument, as if want of Power and Prudential forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance made them not to attempt any thing more, is what cannot fall under the thoughts of a conſidering Perſon. He that by Twelve mean Perſons, as were the Apoſtles, could
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48150:140"/>
convert ſo great a part of the World, by the ſame Power and Inſtruments could he have over-ruled the Perſons of the reſt of the World; to Maſter and bring into Captivity to the Law of Faith, an undiſciplined, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Underſtanding and Will, is as great a Work of the Almighty, as to ſubdue the whole Perſon. The Mind is as difficultly conquer'd as the Body, and more difficultly too; becauſe no immediate outward force can be put upon it. He that when meer Idiots and Ignaro's gave them the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Tongue of the Learned, could alſo have given them the Arm of the Mighty and Valiant. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who with but one word from his Mouth ſtruck dead <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his Wife for cheating the Church, might with one word from his Mouth alſo have reverſed the Edict of <hi>Nero,</hi> appointing him to be crucified at <hi>Rome,</hi> have enfeebled thoſe hands of the Executioner, that nailed and fixed him on the Croſs. St. <hi>Paul</hi> who ſtruck <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer Blind, might have ſmote <hi>Ananias</hi> on the Bench, made that offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reviling Orator <hi>Tertullus</hi> to be Dumb, and baffled <hi>Nero</hi> with all his Power, had outward Coercion and Force been the aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed way to Plant and Propagate Religion, a general courſe ſet up, a ſtanding Rule, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the preſent, or Succeſſion of Ages. However God thought fit to give ſpecial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuch his Power upon particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Sinners, by the hands of his Apoſtles, to let the World ſee it was not againſt the Nature of the Goſpel, though not in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it, thus to have them dealt with in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48150:141"/>
particular Caſes; to preſerve the horror in remembrance, till the appointed time, till the Empire became Chriſtian; in whoſe hands, not the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſion, this outward ſorcing puniſhing part does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, in its conſtant perpetual Seat or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>Ita tunc Deus ſupplebat id quod Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Eccleſiae praeſtare debent, &amp; tunc non Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabant, Grotius,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. Then God did ſupply what the Magiſtrates ought to have diſcharged, and did not; inſtancing in theſe very Puniſhments of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> ſtruck Dead, of <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sorcerer ſtruck Blind, and of the Bodily Diſeaſes ſent out upon others. Our Saviour Chriſt in his Life deſigned and contrived upon every occaſion, when any appearance that others ſhould ſuſpect him, or when any apt opportunity to expreſs and declare himſelf, that he was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to exempt himſelf from any inſtance of Subjection to his Governors, nor exerciſe in any Caſe the Juriſdiction that was theirs, and for this he Pays Tribute, refuſes to divide Inheritances; nor did he invade any one private Perſon, and we read of but one Colt, that he commanded to be brought unto him, to which, as what was his Title we do not read, ſo are we not told of any injury done by it; nor of any Complaint made in the Streets on the occaſion. And his Death, though pre-ordained in the fore determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God, for no one worldly end or deſign, to ſerve no one Political Purpoſe, but ſolely and altogether to ſatisfie for the Sins of Man, to make compleat our Redemption; yet it was ordered that the earthy Governors

ſhould have a Power given them from above, for a legal Proceſs and judicial Trial upon him; he died in a courſe of Law, and a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Obedience to them: And although it muſt be granted that ſome of the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and moſt eminent firſt Chriſtians did Believe and Publiſh to the World, that Chriſt ſhould come again and reign upon Earth in his Perſon, as Supreme Governor of all, and his Saints with and by him in the independent, full freedom, uſe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Goods of this World, and of Senſe, that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be Rebuilt, its Streets enlarged and inhabited by them.

up to the caſe in hand, becauſe there may be ſuch a thing as Domination over the Clergy. Therefore there is no real Power to be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed over them, becauſe <hi>Diotrephes</hi> affected a Superiority where it belong'd not unto him; therefore a Biſhop and a Presbyter muſt be of equal Power. The Church of God muſt not exerciſe Autority as do the Kings of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles;</hi> therefore whatever the Power they execute is, muſt be Tyranny and Uſurpation.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48150:145"/>
and who is inſtructed for the Kingdom of Glory, cannot be ſuppoſed with Knowledge and Judgment enough, ſo to digeſt them, as to be ready to anſwer to every Man that asketh a Reaſon of his Faith that is in him, or ſo as his own need ſhall require, in his daily Confeſſions and Acknowledgments to God. I'le add, ſo as the Duties in common, to be performed by all as Chriſtians, even the moſt learned Scribe among them ſhall exact; for the rehearſing their Faith, and open Confeſſion of it before Men, was a branch of their conſtant Devotions. And it muſt be as impertinent, and unhandſom, when they come together, if every one have a diverſe Interpretation, Digeſtion and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his Faith, as if every one ſhould have a differing Prayer, Hymn, or Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; the World muſt believe them all Mad; nothing can be done to Edification, nothing of Order and Peace, only Confuſion be in the Churches of God. Hence that Summary of what is to be believed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, the Apoſtles Creed, was compoſed, 'tis generally concluded, by the Twelve Apoſtles themſelves; and to which, if St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s form of Doctrine delivered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. his form of ſound words, that good thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>Timothy</hi>'s truſt, to be kept by him, and to be conveigh'd to others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13, 14.2.2. related not; yet thus much may certainly be collected thence, That they had Summaries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, antecedent to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, and which ſuppoſe theſe Doctrines receiv'd; and purſuant to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,

as general needs, and in courſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, or upon particular occaſion of falſe Teachers coming in, thoſe vain Bablings and Oppoſitions of Science falſely ſo called, which ſome Profeſſing, have erred from the Truth; and by which Summaries they were to cenſure and exclude them. And the ſame may be St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Holy Commandment deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. And St. <hi>John</hi>'s Unction received; or that which they heard from the beginning, and which he Exhorts them to abide in, and it will teach them all things, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.20.24.27. but of whatever uſe they were to the conſerving of Truth, and ejection of Hereſies (and which falls not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Head now to purſue.)

ſome after that, according to the meaſure of the Gift which is given, and every one in their own order. God is not the God of Confuſion but of Peace, as in all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Saints; a Power limited to Church-Officers only, ſuch as were at firſt thereunto called, appointed, and inveſted by Chriſt in his own Perſon, or by his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Nor may any Member in common, or barely as a Believer, take unto himſelf this Honor and Function; and the ſelect Perſons herein deputed, were either the Apoſtles, and Seventy, appointed by our Saviour in Perſon; or afterwards thoſe Prophets, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, Paſtors, Teachers, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11. with others then, as occaſion deputed, according to the preſent reaſon of the Churches firſt Planting and Propagation, by thoſe more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Deſcents of the Holy Ghoſt.

Nor was it otherwiſe in their after-Influences and Inſtructions, they were all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like breathed upon at once, receiv'd the ſame Autority, to retain and remit Sins; the Holy Ghoſt fell equally upon them all at once at the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> there univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally and viſibly on their Heads in the face of all Nations; and each one went out a <hi>Theopneuſt,</hi> Independent and ſelf-autoritative, to Preach, and conſtitute Churches; they were only liable to be adviſed, and directed and reprov'd by one another, if occaſion; <hi>

The reſt of the Apoſtles received equal Power with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but as Embaſſadors Extraordinary; <hi>Peter</hi> as Ordinary, and the Head of the Succeſſion; theirs was only for the preſent Service, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Natural lifes, or till recall'd by that ſame Autority that they received it from, his to abide with his Perſon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend in the Succeſſion, and from whence each influence and ſupply, each inſtance of Church-Autority is to be derived throughout all Ages for evermore. So that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Power was more than the reſt in regard on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the abode and during uſe of it. But the bottom here is altogether ſandy; nor does he produce any thing that is Evidence for ſuch the Privilege either to his Perſon or Succeſſion. <hi>Thou art Peter, upon this Rock will I build my Church.</hi> And the Confeſſion preceding, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God,</hi> feed my Sheep. His <hi>firſt Call,</hi> if he had it; and his being left to Poſterity with his Name in the head of them, cannot any one, or all of them, imply any thing like it, to a rational conſidering Perſon. Theſe were occurring Diſcourſes, particular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and accidental; ſuch as in courſe muſt be ſuppoſed to fall in and to be, where a conſtant Converſe, and ſo known a Deſign as was then on foot amongſt them; and the Contingencies of the World cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conceived of, or adjuſted. That ſame is now the Confeſſion of every Chriſtian, and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48150:162"/>
to be ſure, was then of all the Apoſtles, at leaſt e're their Commiſſions were fully delivered, and their Power deputed unto them. The ſecond Call might be as full and extenſive as the firſt, nor does the Precedency imply in its Nature any thing otherwiſe. One branch or inſtance of the Church was firſt founded on St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s perſonal Preaching, and other Adminiſtrations and Church-Offices, in which he officiated, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and the other Apoſtles in the ſame Way and Duties and Power did found and conſtitute others. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had his Apoſtleſhip equally evidenced, nor were its ſeals leſs notorious, our Saviour might as particularly urge the Care of the Church to others, as he did to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and we ought to believe nothing leſs then that he did; that they all ſee to their Duty, in feeding and governing of it. He might have a differing Confidence in one above another, as we are ſure his love was unequal; and that ſomething might happen extraordinary in Diſcourſe by Acknowledgment and Approbation, all this may eaſily be allowed; but that a Commiſſion and Power more laſting, a ſpecial Headſhip and Charge is hereby granted and ſeated for ever, is hence to be inferr'd, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence follows, none that underſtands a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſm, or enquires into but obvious Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, can ſubmit unto it. And therefore <hi>Eſtius</hi> abates a little in his Treatiſe on the Sentences, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Diſt.</hi> 47. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. and ſays, <hi>Verè eſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſalis Epiſcopus,</hi> &amp;c. that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is truly an Univerſal Biſhop, if he be call'd Univerſal Biſhop who has the care of the whole Church; but if you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48150:163"/>
a Univerſal Biſhop, <hi>Qui ſolus omnium Provinciarum &amp; Civitatum Epiſcopus ſit, ſic ut alii non Epiſcopi ſint, ſed unius Epiſcopi, ſeu Pontificis, ſunt Vicarii;</hi> who is Biſhop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone of all Provinces and Cities, ſo as others are not Biſhops, but Vicars of this one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or High Prieſt; then it is plainly to be denied, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Biſhop. He ſeems to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Power of giving of Holy Orders, and the Power of governing the Church; the former he will not allow the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſingular in, and apart from other Biſhops, <hi>Caput Succeſſionis,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will have him to be, the alone Head and Fountain of Prieſtly Succeſſion; as if illegal, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when not derived from his Chair; the latter he peremptorily affixes upon him, and believes him alone inveſted with a Power Univerſal, for the governing the Church of Chriſt, all Chriſtian Biſhops by whomſoever Conſecrated, and his Arm is to rule them, whoſeſoever's Hands were laid upon them; and this ſolitary, and by himſelf; nor is any one a ſharer with, or out of ſubjection to him. To which I ſhall reply, that though the diſtinction in it ſelf, will with very much difficulty be admitted of, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining and governing Parts will be very rarely found aſunder. Nor do I believe there can be an inſtance given of but one Biſhop, who at his Conſecration had the Power of governing left out of the Office in which that other of Ordination together with this were not deſign'd at once and tranſmitted, though the Objects have many times been
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48150:163"/>
changed, either enlarged or limited, as they have been both ſuſpended altogether; yet, allowing the diſtinction, it may poſſibly do <hi>Eſtius</hi> this preſent Kindneſs, lookt upon as a Diſputant, and oppreſſed with an Argument, giving him the opportunity of ſomething like an Anſwer, and with ſome ſhew he may eſcape that ſeverity of words, and blacker cenſure he there acknowledges to be paſſed by St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> in ſeveral Occaſional Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, againſt whomſoever it is ſhall ſtyle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Univerſal Biſhop, or Biſhop of all Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. That the very Name is <hi>Prophane, Proud, Sacrilegious, Diabolical, a Name of Blaſphemy, and the forerunner of Antichriſt;</hi> and all this <hi>Eſtius</hi> there tells us was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd from this Holy Father, by reaſon of the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>'s Ambition in that Nature; declaring, that as the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror did alone hold the Empire, and all Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Governors were ſent by him, and held of him the Head, and not to do it was Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and Treaſon; ſo did he alone hold the Epiſcopacy, and all Holy Orders were to deſcend and flow from him, and to receive them, and not from him, was to climb up the wrong way, and by intruſion come in. But then, what more right he has on his ſide, or better Autority than <hi>Bellarmine</hi> has on his; or how he can prove a ſolitary peculiar Care and Government demandated to, and in its ſpecial Conſtitution, ſettled on St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and by his Succeſſion at <hi>Reme,</hi> or which way ſoever elſe it was, over the Univerſal Church or whole Goſpel-Prieſthood, ſo as to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute him and them its immutable perpetual

Head to Govern, though not to Ordain them; and which was not in the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Perſons, to be ſure not in their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; this does not readily appear, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are favourers of both alike, and indeed give to neither any bottom at all. Nor does any ſuch thing appear in the beſt Antiquity, or ſucceeding Matter of Fact in his behalf; no ill Argument of ever a Divine Right, were it on their ſide.</p>

but thoſe which make us Chriſtians, and which did not at all depend on outward force. Hence it was, till the world came into the Church, that the Prieſthood was maintained by what every one offer'd, upon the forementioned inducements; and as he that denied this maintenance to him that ſerved at the Altar, was ſuppoſed ſtill to deny withal his Faith, and place in the Body of Chriſtians; and ſuitably is it with the greateſt equity and proportion of things, ſtill the continued Practice of the Chriſtian Courts, to Excommunicate or cut off ſuch an one from the Church Communion; ſo neither could they which ſaw no reaſon why them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould become Chriſtians, be ſuppoſed to be convinced, by other reaſons, of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of maintaining thoſe who claimed no other right for the maintenance, than their Preaching and Publiſhing ſuch that Religion. And therefore when upon with-holding of Tithes, or the Churches Revenue, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed farther than Excommunication, to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Confinement; or whatever outward reſtraint, we have no Warrant or Power for this, but from the Prince, and the Laws of the Land alone enable us to do it. 'Tis true, to have a Body or Government in it ſelf di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and apart from that which is Secular, and with its own obligations for maintenance, which way ſoever it ariſes, but more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when from ſo prevailing a motive and engagement, as that which makes men Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and entitles them to Eternity, to have their own bank or ſtock, to what ends or on what Perſons ſoever erogated and expended,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48150:197"/>
it matters not, whether on their Poor, or on their Clergy, (to which add the Power to aſſemble for religious Worſhip, upon the ſame Conſiderations) is what may carry ſome appearance for Suſpitions and Jealouſies from the State, and advantages are poſſible to be taken for undermining and overthrowing of it, upon each occaſion; a Government, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ought to be watchful, and jealous in ſuch Caſes; Premunires, Eſchetes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations, are but due and equitable Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as by Law aſſigned; that ſurely is a very unſafe Rule, I find among other as bad, laid down by Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> in his Sermon, in a caſe not very unlike to this in hand, <hi>He that acknowledges himſelf to derive all his Autority from God, can pretend to none againſt him.</hi> Unleſs wee'l ſuppoſe there can be no Cheats nor Hypocrites, double dealings in the World; or that a power or truſt duely received, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be abuſed and eſtranged; ſuch as deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly Act againſt God, pretend moſtly to his Autority, and often have it really in them.

Nor are thoſe Rules and particular Obſervancies

for holy living, and ſatisfaction injoyn'd by the Confeſſor, to take any Place, to have any force upon the Penitent or Candidates Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, if the Performance be inconſiſtent with, and thwarts any one Duty, by any one of the forementioned relations ariſing, if common-fidelity, Juſtice, or Charity be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thereby in any one inſtance of them, or any be contracted againſt humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and Society. And the tenth Canon of the Apoſtles forbids to Pray with an excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Perſon, but permits to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him; the leſs is ſtill to ſubmit to the greater obligation: And the World with its Neceſſities, I, and Conveniencies too, is always conſidered; there can be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations which infers omiſſions in another kind, eſpecially where the Duty neglected is more obliging; nor is the Arrearage paid by a differing Debt contracted. And by the like Rules alſo is Excommunication it ſelf to he limited, upon the very ſame terms has it its aſſigned force and efficacy; and which, as of it ſelf, neither inveſts with, nor deprives of any earthy Goods, any one inſtance of Wealth, Power or Dominion; ſo is it to he executed alone in compliance with the Neceſſities of Mankind, with thoſe Laws of that Body and Society to which, as Men, they ſtand related; this Diſcipline cannot it be either a <hi>Contempt or Affront to the Magiſtracy or Law;</hi> and then too, when all this is, as it ought to be, duly obſerved, as to theſe generals, a great deal is left to the prudence and diſcretion of the Inſtrument, 'tis purſued only on rational Grounds and Motives, and

And therefore this inſtance of the Power of the Keys, though deputed to every one that is ordain'd a Presbyter; yet by Church Laws and uſuage, upon Prudence and Prediſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the execution is limited, and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop only has it, or ſome other in ſpecial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation from him, to that particular purpoſe, and ſince the Empire became Chriſtian, the Laws of it have preſcribed, and gave limits to the Biſhops themſelves, as to Perſons, and the reaſons of their Excommunications, and which the Church in good Ages of it did own and comply with. There were many other notorious offenders in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and deſerved St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Animadverſions too, as well as that one inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> who alone was there Excommunicated by him. <hi>Longè aliter iſta, longè aliter vitioſa curanda &amp; ſananda eſt multitudo;</hi> but the proceeding againſt a multitude is to be of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than that againſt one ſingle notorious Sinner; a Schiſm may be occaſioned, and the Wheat be pull'd up with ſo many Tares, and inſtead of curing the Diſtemper it ſpread farther; as St. <hi>Auſtin, Tom.</hi> 7. <hi>Poſt.

And <hi>Valleſius annot. in Euſeb. hiſt. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 23. gives theſe two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, becauſe his Sentence was denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced when abſent, and he had not legal Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and it was not confirmed by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> though to me a more probable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be given than either, for the illegality of the proceeding and the no effect it had, the ancient Canons of the Church ſtill forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any one of the hieratical Order, whether Biſhop, Presbyter or Deacon, to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. Excommunication was the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for the Laity; the Clergies was Depoſition; nor were the Clergy ſubject to the other, till removed from the Prieſthood. And certainly then much leſs can it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in reaſon, and as agreeable with the common courſes of foreſight and diſcretion, that other things are managed in the Goſpel with, that this Ordinance ſhould on ſuch terms be inſtituted and put in execution as to reach Kings themſelves, and with leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and conſideration, than to Perſons in

Holy Orders, and be concluded more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily and immediately to take effect upon them, as if inconveniences, and that over-ballance whatever the propoſed advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage may be, may not here be a conſequent alſo. Princes, 'tis true, are equally ſubject to the Laws of Chriſt and his Church, and they muſt come to Heaven in the ſame Path that the meaneſt of their Subjects do come in; they are to be urg'd and taught publickly, as are others, and particularly in private, and where due opportunity to be ſeverely war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of; but then upon a ſuppoſed failure to proceed to an open publick Excluſion; this, if in any one inſtance elſe, ought firſt to be weigh'd and conſider'd, whether it be likely to have due effect, to be for the good of the Church in general, which his outward arm alone can protect? and whether inſtead of reducing him as to his Perſon, it may not much more harden him, and eſpecially ſince his Perſon falls under no farther Coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, than his engagements to Chriſtianity lay upon him. Examples of Kings are ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influential and prevailing, and whether a greater deluge of Prophaneneſs may not be let in by ſo doing? or again, whether the expoſing him to ſhame and contumely, would not withal expoſe his reputation to the contempt of his People; and thus not only Religion and Morality, but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Peace and Quiet of the Realm might be expoſed to danger, and the both Church and State be liable to inrodes and violence thereby, we believe it to be what was appointed by God, and ſuppoſed by
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48150:201"/>
our Saviour, in the lay and frame of our Chriſtianity, that the Secular Power receive no abatement; but on the contrary, every of its Prerogatives be ſtrengthen'd, by its ſpreading over and reception in the World. Since every other relation is to continue and be obliging, ſo alſo muſt this of Kings, which came into the World with the firſt, is connate and coaevous with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, the Foundation was laid for both at once, and Kings and Subjects are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſo long as Fathers and Children, the race of Mankind is on Earth continued; and ſuitably to this firſt contrivance, no ſooner did the Empire come in to the Church, and engage in Chriſtianity, but Emperors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves, and the Church joyfully receiv'd them for its Nurſing Father, and the Prince is the Supreme Governor there, the Laws and Judicatures are the Kings, and our Biſhops give Citations in their own Names, but by an antecedent Power derived from, and by the Prince devolved unto them. And the Biſhops of old, were ſo far from aſſuming to themſelves any ſuch outward Coercive Power, as to make Citations of mens Perſons, to proceed by Court Proceſs and Penal Mulcts, that when they laid the Plot for Lay-Deputies, Chancellors, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries, Officials, or whatever title they went under, to ſit in their Courts, and give occaſional Judgments (for what private rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I cannot tell, but the pretended is this, that it was leſs decent that they being Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Perſons ſhould mingle themſelves in Secular Affairs.) they could not conſtitute
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48150:202"/>
ſuch their Deputies, nor erect ſuch an Order, but by a ſpecial Grant and Seal from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror (a firm Argument that the Power was not originally theirs) and they ſuitably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate him in order to it, and he yields to their demand, but gives a Caution that the Church be not dammaged thereby, a thing in courſe to be ſuſpected; and perhaps the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the Church has ſince had, that the Courts for her Juſtice are the Biſhops, and her Cauſes fall not immediately under a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Cognitor, are ſo little and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that though the firſt Piety and royal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence is apparent; yet the preſent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is hardly diſcernible at this day among us, <hi>Vid.

Thoſe rules of Policy which were contrived, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with, and ſubmitted to in the firſt planting the Goſpel, ſeem not conſiſtent with ſuch an after-practice, a Presbyter was not to be Excommunicated till firſt depoſed, and yet then ſhall each ſingle Presbyter Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Prince?

the Church of God never pretended to it, 'twas what ſhe always abhorred; but that the Conſiderations muſt needs weigh more, and be much rather cogent; that the cenſure go not out againſt a Prince, and greater incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences muſt hence follow, whatever they were the ancient Church did apprehend to be a conſequent to the other, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon foreſight of things could not alſo allow it.

               </argument>
               <p>THERE is but one thing now behind that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> ſeems to me to be conſidered, as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the cleering this Diſcourſe; and 'tis in the caſe juſt now ſtated. As ſuppoſe the Canons of the Church, and the Laws of the State, ſhould really and actually ſtand in competition, that they enjoyn and prohibit the ſame action at the ſame time, or at leaſt ſo as the deſigns of both cannot at once be ſerved and complied with, and which is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſuppoſed, and muſt fall out, where are two Soveraign independent Powers over one and the ſame Subjects. This Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> aggravates as that Kingdom divided in it ſelf and cannot ſtand, it muſt neceſſarily diſtract a People, and expoſe them to the greateſt inconveniences; 'tis a dividing the Soveraign Power, here is a Supremacy againſt Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, Canons againſt Laws, a Ghoſtly
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48150:207"/>
autority againſt the Civil, two Kingdoms and each Subject to, muſt obey two Maſters, who both will have the Commands obſerv'd as Law, which is impoſſible. This he places among his other effects of an imperfect inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, is reckoned up and urged by him among the Infirmities of a Common-wealth: nay more, as what is, againſt the Eſſence of it, in the number of thoſe things that weaken and tend to its diſſolution, <hi>Leviathan, Part.</hi> 2 <hi>cap.</hi> 29. And all this as objected by Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> is eaſily anſwer'd, and has been over and over again in this Diſcourſe, for it proceeds alone upon that falſe precarious ſuppoſition, and pertinaciouſly reſolv'd upon Principle of his, and his other Friends above reckoned up; as <hi>Eraſtus, Selden, Salmaſius,</hi> &amp;c. which have formerly perplexed the World therewith, and ſtill do in their Adherents. That there is no Power but what is outwardly cogent upon mens Perſons or Eſtates or Liberties, working by ſenſible force and impreſſions, no other Kingdom but what is of this World, unleſs a Kingdom of Fairies, in the dark, as <hi>Hobbs</hi> ridicules it, for thus he argues againſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and concludes his Enquiries all in vain, whether the Power of the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ought to be Monarchical, Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Democratical; becauſe all theſe Powers are Soveraign and Coercive, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly none of them can belong to him as from Chriſt, <hi>Part</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 42. And hence he argues on in the next Section, For if the Supreme King have not his Regal Power in this World, by what autority can Obedience be required of his Officers? with abundance of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48150:207"/>
the ſame almoſt every where. But yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there appears ſome ſhew of objection in the thing it ſelf, and it may fall under ſome doubt with a leſs, but conſcientious, conſidering Perſon, whether it be likely, and alſo conſiſtent with obedience to, and the ends of Government, that two ſuch Powers, both obliging, ſhould be erected over one and the ſame ſubject, and in what caſe it will be that they are to obey. I ſhall add far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
               <p>THAT if this Concluſion be good, That <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>II</label> therefore there ought to be no Church Power nor Laws at all diſtinct from thoſe of the State, becauſe at ſome one time or other both may ſtand in competition; and the ſame Action, at the ſame time may fall under an Injunction and Prohibition; and theſe Laws of the Church muſt of neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence overthrow and over-rule thoſe of the State: the ſame is equally deducible from the Laws of God and Chriſt, immediately given by them, or their Meſſengers the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; all which will be as much liable to the ſame conſequence, and found ſome times or other, many times, to be ſure, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent in the particular practice, as to what the Secular Power may be neceſſitated to command. The Duties to be performed in the Congregation, as Prayer, attending the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are what are the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Chriſt, and obliging every Chriſtian; and yet in the time of War, in order to publick Juſtice, by the very acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and contingencies of man's life, do and muſt come croſs in Mr. <hi>Hobb</hi>'s ſenſe, and
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48150:208"/>
the Governments diſſolution muſt be alſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded thereby; and 'twill be the ſame where the Goſpel-Commands reach the Imperate Acts of the Will, as they ſpeak, or organical Duties, and which require ſet times and place, and motions in the Performance; and yet theſe were Soveraign Laws notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, when actually, and in their perſons given by Chriſt and the Apoſtles; then, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> acknowledges them to be ſuch, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſuperſeded on diverſe Conſiderations, not ſo particularly engaging the Performance at ſome times, and yet ſtill continuing to be obliging, as in their ſeveral deſigns and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; and none do any more. And <hi>Herod</hi> indeed, ſuſpected a Diſſolution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by it; theſe very Laws of God compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with one another, as with thoſe of the Civil Magiſtrate upon theſe mens inferences, muſt ceaſe, were unduly impoſed, becauſe they are not at all times, by reaſon of one another, practicable; and 'tis equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to Mourn and to Rejoyce, to Faſt and to be Hoſpitable, to be upon my knees at Prayer, and to be doing Juſtice on the Bench, to obey God and my King in the ſame Perſon, at one and the ſame time, and in the ſame Duties, as to obey Soveraignty and Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, Canons and Laws, a Ghoſtly and a Civil Autority, and all or none; are on the ſame account to be placed in oppoſition. If the Objection has any force, as Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> thinks it has, and lays his full ſtreſs againſt Eccleſiaſtical Laws upon it: And again, if whatever is from a due inſtitution, and from juſt autority, then looſes its Sanction and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48150:208"/>
Nature, is to be null'd and to ceaſe; if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Conſiderations ſuſpended for ſome time, ſomething more weighty, more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or abſolutely neceſſary may intervene, and it is not at that time to be practiſed and complied with; or thus, becauſe not always practicable it ought not to be enjoyn'd at all, then ſundry of God's own Laws muſt ceaſe to oblige and that for ever, or were unjuſt in their Enactions; becauſe obliging to practice only in their due times and circumſtances. The affirmative Precepts of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments themſelves will fail one way or both; nor does any pretend in his Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Decalogue, to make but ſenſe of ſuch thoſe Precepts, without firſt laying down that diſtinction of <hi>ſemper</hi> and <hi>ad ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> preſuppoſing and taking it for a truth, that, that which is always a Law, and of it ſelf obliging, does not actually engage to performance at every time, has only its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeaſons for practice; if then a compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing and adjuſtment is not allow'd to be made in one inſtance, 'tis not in the other; and, if in any one, 'tis in all; we can as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily reconcile the Laws of the Church in their Practice with the Laws of the State, as we can the immediate Laws of God and Chriſt, as we can the Laws of God with one another, and thorow Obedience in every reſpect, is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſible, the ſame humane Prudence and Diſcretion, one and the ſame; but courſe of things, their Natures and Obligations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, will determine and adjuſt in one as in the other, and which not preſuppoſed, and made uſe of in all, there will be indeed,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48150:209"/>
only juſtling and thwarting, as to all our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, and at laſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Diſſolution. Now in order to this, in regard to the Soveraignty and Supremacy, Laws and Canons, Civil and Ghoſtly Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as 'tis phraſed, and which is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the particular concern; what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid in the former Chapter concerning Church Cenſures, Penances, Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Canons of Councils, and their particular Obligations, might ſuffice in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and ſatisfie any ſerious inquirer. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature is to be of force, if ſhutting out any antecedent immutable known Duty, implying Rebellion and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thwarting what is upon any occaſional Neceſſity, or appearance of a conveniency, commanded by the lawful Civil Power; the Church always aſſerts, owns, and pleads for Princes, and what ſhe enjoyns cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be of force, or by her intendment, if againſt them. But my purpoſe is to go a little farther in compliance with this preſent opportunity, and to conſider the Laws of the Church, in the large acceptation, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Laws of Religion in general, whether meerly Humane and Eccleſiaſtical, or more purely and immediately Divine, given by Chriſt and his Apoſtles in their Perſons and Inſtances, whether as to Poſitive inſtitutions or Moral, and in regard to each of which, what is the force and autority of a civil Command, how far it either ſuſpends, or diſengageth; and I the rather alſo do it, take this latitude, becauſe the one when well conſidered, will add light, and much
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48150:209"/>
contribute to the better underſtanding of the other; eſpecially to the clearing of the point of Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Power, their extent and obligations.</p>
               <p>NOW in order to this, Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> himſelf <label type="milestone">

They are ſuch as are Arbitrary in their Sanction and Enacting, without any antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Neceſſity, as to the particular inſtance, and might have been theſe or other, but are Humane only and Eccleſiaſtical, conſtituted and limited by the Biſhops and Governors of the Church, in their Canons and Rules to that purpoſe, and which together with the decency, and aptneſs, and uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the things themſelves, renders obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. 2. They are ſuch as are equally Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary, and without any foregoing Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as are the former, the reaſon and force of which depends upon the choice and Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Law-giver; but here is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, theſe Laws are Divine, their Author

and Inſtitutor is Chriſt, or ſuch as were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inſpir'd, miraculouſly and in an extraordinary manner commiſſioned by him in order to this very thing. Such are the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which might have been other than they now are, had he pleaſed. 3. They are ſuch as are no ways Arbitrary in the inſtance, but follow neceſſarily and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally upon the ſuppoſal and reception of Religion, and this, whether the Religion be that of Nature, immediately flowing from our Natural Relations and dependency to and upon God, and one another; ſuch are all the Acts of Natural Religion, as Faith and Relyance upon God, Prayer and Praiſes, and Thankſgivings to him, an Imitation and Copying out of his Purity and Holineſs, Love, and Faith, and Juſtice, being tender-hearted and affectionate to one another, with more of the like nature, and to which all Mankind is oblig'd immutably and for ever, not by any poſitive-ſuperadded Law or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, but by the force and neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of his Creation, connate and congenious with mans being and ſubſiſtency, and the firſt Notions of Religion; Man muſt fall from his Orb, ceaſe his own proper inſtincts and operations without them; or whether the Religion be founded in the Offices of Chriſt, to which he was ſince deputed of the Father upon Earth, as a King, Prophet and Prieſt, in order to Man's Redemption, and is in part now executed in Heaven, to govern, teach, ſatisfie and intercede for him; and which implies and includes, in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and purpoſe, whatever Duty and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

Now theſe Laws though in themſelves obliging, and each Chriſtian, as a Member of that Society, ſtands immediately engag'd unto them; nor can any other Foreign Power repeal or null them as to their Sanction, yet there may be, there is to be, a Ceſſation as to Practice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome Caſes and Circumſtances, and the particular local Performance may be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded at preſent, or ſuſpended for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; nor do the terms for Heaven conſiſt in the forbearance, or ſhut out of the Church-Society becauſe of it, little Accidents and Contingencies, not to be foreſeen, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, will oft obſtruct, and become lawful Impediments; and much more where the Civil Power comes thwarting upon us, and renders Church Laws impracticable, a Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inhibition upon Penalties and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, which tend to the greater Damage of our common Chriſtianity if incurr'd, and to the ſilencing and abating from Duties of a higher concern.

And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame account it is, and the Parity of Reaſon, that even particular Acts of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Inſtitutions and Worſhip of God, give way to Obedience to Governors, and when the common Political good of Mankind is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, as I ſhall have occaſion to inſtance farther hereafter.

We ſee farther, the ſame infinite love and tender care of his towards Man, every ways providing for his Heaven and Salvation, in that, having placed him here in this World, liable to the Accidents and Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of it, the changes and chances of this mortal Life, what otherways was his Duty, and Heaven not attainable, but in obſervancy of its Laws and Rules, is upon theſe like ſcores abated and remitted to him; where either the Natural incapacities, or other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the World, in order to its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Government injoyn it, and no one thing for Eternal Salvation is always a Duty, in the intendment of the Sanction, with the execution or rigorous exerciſe of which the Advantages that are are Temporal, and their due conſervation are inconſiſtent. Grace does not deſtroy Nature, and where God is to be obey'd, and not Man, where the Commands of both are incompetible, and ſuch we have ſhew'd there are, or may be, the Obedience to God, as in all reaſon, is firſt to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, ſo is it, what alone is the benefit of Mankind, there is not one inſtance of what is antecedent Duty, or is really beneficial unto him, abated thereby, and we cannot be either good Men, or good Subjects, if vicious in

our Morals, if once we renounce theſe higher Duties of Chriſtianity. God has not made that the immutable term of Man's Salvation, but what is in his own Power, and of which if he fails, 'tis his own perverſe will and choice that is debauch'd and betrays him to it; the Carved works of the Temple may be beaten down, the Church-Diſcipline be weakned, and her Laws and Rules for Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs become of leſs force; her Towers and Bulwarks be taken away, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Protection be withdrawn.

That Princes may preſcribe what Faith they liſt, what Service of God they pleaſe, what form of Adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments they think beſt, is no part of our thoughts, nor point of our Doctrine, for external Power and Autority to compel and puniſh, which is the Point we ſtand upon, God hath preferr'd the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prieſt, <hi>pag.</hi> 223. touching the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of their own Perſons and Lives, Princes owe the very ſame Reverence and Obedience to the Word and Sacraments, that every private Man doth: and if any Prince would be baptized, or approach the Lord's Table, with manifeſt ſhew of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief or irrepentance, the Miniſter is bound freely to ſpeak, or rather to lay down his life at the Princes feet, than to let the King of Kings to be provoked, the Myſteries to be defiled, his own Soul and the Princes endanger'd, for lack of oft and earneſt Admonition, <hi>pag.</hi> 226. by Governors we do not mean Moderators, Preſcribers, Directors, Inventers, or Authors of theſe things, but Rulers or Magiſtrates, bearing

the Sword, to permit and defend that which Chriſt himſelf firſt appointed and ordained, and with lawful force to diſturb the Deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of his lawful Will and Teſtament. Now what inconvenience is this, if we ſay that Princes as publick Magiſtrates, may give freedom, protection and aſſiſtance to the preaching of the Word, miniſtring of the Sacraments, and right uſing of the Keys, and not fetch licenſe from <hi>Rome? pag.</hi> 236. Princes have no right to call and confirm Preachers, but to receive ſuch as be ſent of God, and give them liberty for their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and ſecurity for their Perſons, and if Princes refuſe ſo to do, God's Labourers muſt go forward with that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them from Heaven, not by diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing Princes from their Thrones, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading their Realms, but by mildly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves to the Powers on Earth, and meekly ſuffering, for the defence of the truth, what they ſhall inflict.</q>

                  </q> But this is what only the ill Nature and Malice of our Adverſaries would have us to believe and aſſert, and give out to the World we do; 'tis what is, and all along has been repell'd with ſcorn and indignation both by our Princes in their ſingle Perſons, and in their Laws in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and though ſome of our Divines have wiſhed the Oath had been more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly

<pb n="486" facs="tcp:48150:264"/>
of Truth, he doubted not to yield to this Opinion of <hi>Leighton's,</hi> and this is plain in Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Manuſcript, in which is to be ſeen <hi>Th.

Why Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> did leave out this paſſage in his <hi>Irenicum</hi> 'tis plain, becauſe it thwarts his particular deſign, and he had loſt the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſo conſiderable a Name and Autority, as <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s, before his moſt falſe Aſſertion, That <hi>Ordination</hi> is not <hi>appropriated to Biſhops;</hi> and for which in that Treatiſe he ſo contends, it takes down ſomewhat of their <hi>Top-gallant.</hi> As I remember, ſomewhere in that Book, he expreſſes their ſolitary Power, he wondred no queſtion with himſelf how at thoſe years he could find out ſuch a Book to preſent the World with, and indeed well he might, and when he had read ſo far as ſerved his preſent turn, went no farther, otherwiſe he would have enquired alſo a little better into the time when this conference was, and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded it on the World, as done by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of our Reformation; though 'tis agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough with the following Teſtimonies of the Biſhops and Doctors of our Church in the ſame point of Epiſcopacy, and which, to ſay no worſe of them, are lame and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as is here his account of the <hi>Manuſcript.</hi> But what ſhould move Doctor <hi>Burnet</hi> to omit it I cannot imagine; that it was not his purpoſe to leave <hi>Cranmer</hi> to Poſterity, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Eraſtian or Independent, and of which
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:48150:264"/>
he is juſtly to be ſuſpected otherwiſe; this is plain from his own account of him, <hi>Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Pag</hi> 289. where he tells us, <q>In <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Paper, relating to this very Conference, ſome ſingular Opinions of his about the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Eccleſiaſtical Offices will be found; but as they are delivered by him with all poſſible Modeſty; ſo they were not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed as the Doctrine of the Church, but laid aſide as particular Conceits of his own, and it ſeems that afterwards he changed his opinion;</q> and having ſaid this, why might he not have Printed out the whole Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, and which is but the very ſame thing, only more ſatisfactory to the World, and the Doctor had dealt more clear and ingenuous in the Matter, nor is he quite to be acquitted from ſome little ſiniſter end, and clawing therein a thing not to the advantage of an Hiſtorian; eſpecially ſince he Printed out of another part of that <hi>Manuſcript</hi> the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops judgment ſo fully, with Eight other Biſhops concerning the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> denying the Prince any Church-Power thereby, and which is peculiar only to thoſe that are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and ſent by Chriſt Jeſus, as his Father ſent him into the World, and inveſted him with it, and alſo in a <hi>Declaration of the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Divine Inſtitution of Biſhops and Prieſts,</hi> Subſcribed by him, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and Eleven Biſhops, and Twenty Divines and Canoniſts; declaring that the Power of the Keys, and other Church Functions is formally diſtinct from the Power of the Sword, Printed in his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda,</hi> Num. 5. at the end of his Hiſtory;
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:48150:265"/>
and indeed that Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> did ſo alter his Judgment, as the Dean of <hi>Windſor</hi> tells us he did, in Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript; there is Evidence ſufficient from the alone <hi>Book of Ordination,</hi> and the Preface to it; which was compoſed and made publick by him, and others, to be ſure ſome of them, theſe very Biſhops and Doctors mentioned there, and by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> in his <hi>Cottonian</hi> Manuſcript, it being done in the firſt year of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, and where the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Miniſters wholly depend on the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and their Inſtitution; but when all is ſaid and done that can be, ſuch particular Conferences as theſe, if duly conſidered and in their Circumſtances, can avail little for or againſt either Party, nor can <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Opinion, or any other Doctors be reported with Juſtice, out of any ſuch their Papers. The greateſt advantage the Reformation had in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. was that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one had encouragement to think, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to offer, and in Conferences ſome muſt act the adverſe part, and every thing muſt be ſtated, and propoſed, and urged too, and though the opportunity and curioſity of ſome, did not do amiſs in collecting and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſuch Diſcourſes, yet I cannot but think it leſs Diſcretion in Printing and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing them, and leaſt of all, to ſay no worſe, in urging them as the ſenſe and judgment of our Reformers, and not to be endured, when in oppoſition to our received and eſtabliſhed Church Articles, Laws, Rubricks and Book of Ordination, which and which alone, upon the full enquiry and debate, each Propoſal

and perpetually obliging,</hi> 'tis his Objection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that their own Principles will not bear them out in it. This is the caſe, theſe Doctors aſſert over and over again, as they muſt do, if agreeing with our Church, and their own Subſcriptions, that the Scriptures are not a full and perfect Rule for Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and Government, and there is ſtill a Power in the Church to make Laws, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion offers, even to vary from Examples of Diſcipline and Government, which has there been practiſed. <hi>Parker</hi> thinks he has the advantage, and concludes upon them, that then the Government by Biſhops is changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble alſo, and which is ſounded only on Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Example, and who reply, that though they can make Laws in ſome Caſes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them as occaſion, yet in all they cannot: though ſome Examples in Scripture do not, yet others do neceſſarily oblige, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples they produce neceſſarily obliging are theſe. <hi>Impoſition of Hands in Ordinations, that to impoſe Hands is appropriated to Biſhops, as the Apoſtles Succeſſors.

Presbyter, 'till of late in theſe parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom: who thence take the riſe for their Schiſm, and 'tis the ground they ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for the battery and aboliſhing the whole Order, and with-drawing their obedience, and which to be ſure St. <hi>Jerome</hi> never did, nor attempted, and herein they are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly unlucky, they beat down Biſhops by St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Autority, to bring in their Schiſm, and 'tis the main Argument, they ſtill urge againſt them, in the height of theſe Diviſions and Diſtractions are now on foot in <hi>Europe,</hi> and then too when they contend, that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> knew no other occaſion or uſe of Biſhops, but <hi>ad tollenda Schiſmata;</hi> becauſe Schiſms and Diviſions cannot be kept out of the Church, but by them. So that, St. <hi>Jerome</hi>'s Autority, if any thing in their preſent Caſe, muſt be againſt them, and if complying with him, they muſt for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent expedience, ſubmit unto Biſhops, whom they'l allow to have acknowledged this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and uſefulneſs of them, what ever reaſons elſe he ſaw for their inſtitution and continuance.

<pb n="510" facs="tcp:48150:276"/>
he was in the wrong, 'twas then their work to abdicate the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and caſe him of that Primacy and uſurpation he had exerciſed over this Church, and it might ſo happen that in giving to the King what was his, he abated too much of the Power of the Prieſthood and the Church, and which was hers, and not to be given to any other, and yet even this Error did he ſee at laſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged it to Doctor <hi>Leighton,</hi> ſubmitted to and ſubſcribed the truth againſt it, as the Dean of <hi>Windſor</hi> tell us he read it in Doctor <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Manuſcript, and in his preſence. And there is enough to be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this nature in the behalf of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Offers are made againſt our three eminent Biſhops, <hi>Whitgift, Bilſon</hi> and <hi>Bancroft,</hi> and which will ſo thoroughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit them of the but ſuſpition of <hi>Eraſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm;</hi> that the Bill muſt in courſe be flung out, that is drawn up againſt them, every one knows, that is converſant in thoſe their Writings, whence <hi>Parker</hi>'s Objections are taken.

What fourth Regiment can we find for Lay-Elders?</q> All that can be ſaid is this, there appear'd an Argument againſt a Lay-Elder, he was thought thus ſhut out from having any Place or Power as from Chriſt, not conſidering the ill diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the offices of Chriſt, in general, and his bad-placed Succeſſions, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the worſer conſequence, that muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, a deriving the Magiſtrates Power from the Mediatorſhip, and 'tis what neither <hi>Whitgift</hi> nor <hi>Bancroft</hi> did Conſider. As a King, Prieſt and Prophet, he erected and ſettled his Church on Earth, by virtue of that Commiſſion; and <hi>All Power given him of the Father,</hi> Mat. 11. but he did not, as ſuch,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:48150:278"/>
meddle with the Kingdoms on Earth as the Mediator, he was himſelf a Subject, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and practiſed Subjection and Obedience, demanded only the Subjects right, Protection by the Government he found eſtabliſhed in the World by his Father. But however the preſent Argument was wrong laid, and whenceſoever the Magiſtrates Power is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, 'tis all along, and by them all, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and maintained quite different and apart from that of the Miniſtry, or the Prieſthood, and they are aſſerted two quite diverſe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and their Powers do not reach to one another. I'le only now inſtance in Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> Cap. 9. pag. 113. <q>As for Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, if you take it for removing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly from the Civil Society of the Faithful, until they conform themſelves to a more Chriſtian ſort of life; this he takes to be the Power of a Chriſtian Magiſtrate: and he goes on and ſays, I am not averſe that the whole Church where he is wanting, did and ſhould concur in that action, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſooner, when all the Multitude joyn with the Paſtor in one Mind to renounce all manner of converſing with ſuch, will the Parties be reduced to a better mind, to ſee themſelves rejected and exiled from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but 'tis the Paſtors charge only to deliver or deny the Sacraments, <hi>Pag.</hi> 114.147. but otherwiſe Lay-men that are no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, may not challenge to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Paſtors Function, or over-rule them in their own Charge, without manifeſt and violent intruſion on other mens Callings without the Word and Will of Chriſt, who
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:48150:279"/>
gave his Apoſtle the Holy Ghoſt, to remit and retain Sins. And ſo expreſly again, <hi>p.</hi> 149. If you joyn not Lay-Elders in thoſe Sacred and Sacerdotal Actions with Paſtors, but make them Overſeers and Moderators of thoſe things which Paſtors do, this Power belongeth exactly to Chriſtian Magiſtrates, to ſee that Paſtors do their Duty exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of Chriſt, and not to abuſe their Power to annoy his Church or the Members thereof; neither is the caſe alike betwixt Paſtors and Lay-Elders. Paſtors have their Power and Function diſtinguiſhed from Princes by God himſelf; inſomuch that it were more than Preſumption for Princes to execute thoſe actions by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or by their Subſtitutes. To Preach, Baptize, retain Sins &amp; impoſe Hands, Princes have no Power; the Prince of Princes, even the Son of God, hath ſevered it from their Callings, and committed it to his Apoſtles, and they by impoſition of hands derived it to their Succeſſors; but to cauſe theſe actions to be orderly done according to Chriſt's Commandment, and to prevent and redreſs abuſes in the doers, this is all that is left for Lay-Elders, and this is all that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for the Chriſtian Magiſtrate,</q> and that no other Church-Power was then thought by any to belong to the Prince; he was not at all conſidered as its Subject, there was no ſuch thing as a pretence then on foot, 'tis moſt plain, <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>pag.</hi> 108. and among the many Conceits about the Power of the Keys, and Subject, this never entred into the heart o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Prince be not inveſted, he has no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over his People; a great part always will, and all may when they will, exempt their Perſons and Actions from his cognizance and inſpection, upon pretence of their Faith, and Religion, but there is not a word of any one Derivation as from Chriſt; nor as the Mediator, doth he, can he, beſtow any ſuch Power upon them, or are Kings thus <hi>under</hi> him, or any ways, then as Members of his Body, and as Chriſtians; they are to ſubmit to, and receive his Laws in order to Heaven, and theſe Laws are to be their Rule in their Government upon Earth, which they are to obey and protect, which indeed ſupports and exalts them, as Righteouſneſs does a Nation; but 'tis in and by that Autority they were inveſted in before Chriſt, and they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in a feeble piteous Caſe if no other Power to rule with, than what the crucifyed Jeſus can give them, whoſe Kingdom was not of this World; nor did he manage any thing by the Powers of it; I know it is the leaſt of the Deſigns of ſuch that ſtill uſe this Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in their Prayers and Diſcourſes, and they have great Examples for it, and of thoſe who abominate the natural and direct conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are thence to be drawn, where the Civil Power is return'd into the Mediator; but it throughly anſwers their Expectations, who contend to have their Prince a Prieſt too, and would delight more to ſee him in his Rochet, and at the Altar, Bleſſing and Conſecrating, than on his Throne and with his Scepter, ſweying and governing his People, and for which latter they believe themſelves equally

capacitated and enabled as he, and their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief on theſe Grounds is well bottomed; for Chriſt when aſcending up on high, gave no other Gifts to Men, than what either enabled to the work of the Miniſtry, and which alone were for peculiar Perſons; or what made Chriſtians good and virtuous men only; and which were to all promiſcuous and common.
